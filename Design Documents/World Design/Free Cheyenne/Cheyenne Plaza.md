Overview:
The Plaza is the walled city of Free Cheyenne, where the businesses and wealthier citizens reside. A very clear level of prosperity for the citizens of Free Cheyenne should be visible in the world when implementing props and clutter. For comparison, Mr. House has had 7 years before the events of F:NV to renovate the Strip. The Cheyennites have had their city-state for 195 years. 

A key detail to remember when designing the areas is that the Cheyennites rebuilt a lot of the city by stripping down surviving buildings across the wasteland and then reassembling the materials in their city in order to preserve a spirit of living Americana. People living across the wasteland are living by more practical means like log cabins in the Rocky Mountains, abandoned concrete buildings in the urban areas of the Corridor, and dugouts if they live closer to the Cauldron.
