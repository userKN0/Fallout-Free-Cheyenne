The design of the Corridor Wasteland should reflect a small part of the wasteland having recovered from the nuclear holocaust. The scars of war are still visible and the land is still healing, but fresh water coming down from the Rocky Mountains has made the land livable. This, however, has drawn people from across the wasteland to this oasis who will kill and die to control it because war never changes.

The biomes of the Corridor Wasteland vary with location. The western region is temperate and mountainous, while the eastern region is flat and arid. Settlements based on their proximity to these disparate regions should adapt accordingly. People should be ready for wet and cold weather near the Rockies, in contrast those out near the Cauldron should build their houses to stay out of the heat and dust. 


The most important task for designing the world is to balance the engine limitations of Fallout: New Vegas with the creative vision of Fallout: Free Cheyenne. Some key notes are below.

*High FPS is key to keeping an enjoyable experience for players. Avoid creating environments that drag performance down. 

*NPC Limit: Cells in the game whether they are exterior or interior seem to have a limit of 4 NPCs performing radiant AI tasks. Once an NPC population gets above 4, there is a major impact to performance for this game on mid-tier systems. NPCs use far less system resources if they are performing a single AI behaviour, like sitting or playing an animation, so you can use more of them for a cell. The goal should be to use radiant AI behavior as little as possible, and cell populations as interesting as possible. 

*Always Be Optimizing. Roombounds are your friend.
