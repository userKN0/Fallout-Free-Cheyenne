OVERVIEW

A professional tracker and ghoul, Sofia was hired for the East Forty Expedition from New Reno where she worked for the Bishops in hunting down people who wronged them. 

BIOGRAPHY

Sofia Delgado was a Pre-War singer and starlet during the 2070s. Beginning her career singing in bars, she eventually worked her way up to performing at night clubs and musicals. She eventually caught the attention of the producer Harry Waugh. The pair fell in love and he became determined to make her a star.

Thanks to Harry her career began to take off, but as she became more successful the more insecure he became. Things came to a head when Harry, in a drunken rage, accused her of having an affair with the romantic male lead of a movie she was making. The fight escalated to the point where Harry attempted to kill her with a golf iron, but thanks to some quick thinking she turned the tide and ended up killing him in self defense with the club. 

In the end, Sofia's talent agent managed to cover up Harry's death as robbery gone wrong. Sofia herself never truly got over what happened between her and Harry as she still loved him deeply. The career she worked so hard to grow and protect was nevertheless taken away when the Great War occurred.  

Sofia managed to survive the war thanks to filming on location outside of St. George, Utah. Despite being safe from the initial blasts, the fallout caught up with the cast and crew. Sofia and those who survived attempted to return home to Los Angeles, greatly encouraged by finding Las Vegas still mostly intact. Upon finding Los Angeles having been turned into the Boneyard, the group splintered off with each survivor attempting to find a place in the new world. Sofia returned to what remained of her home and recovered the golf club that Harry attacked her with years before, and set out into the wasteland. 

Sofia would eventually find Necropolis and live there until the Unity attacked, scattering the surviving residents to Gecko, Dayglow, and Broken Hills. She would move to New Reno, developing her gambling addiction that began in Necropolis. With booze, drugs, and sex unavailable to ghouls, one of the last pleasures remaining to them was gambling. In order to pay for her habit, Sofia did work for the crime families either by finding people who were hiding from them or luring them into a trap. Often Sofia would get paid from her work and then proceed to lose most of it at the tables in New Reno. 

Sofia was able to get work as a tracker due to being able to go into irradiated areas where other bounty hunters would be unable to pursue. 


STORY

When Sofia arrives in Free Cheyenne for the first time, she is astonished by a society where ghouls are on top of the hierarchy instead of downtrodden. If the player sides with the Legion or SoC against Free Cheyenne, she will leave the player's party and the expedition completely.
