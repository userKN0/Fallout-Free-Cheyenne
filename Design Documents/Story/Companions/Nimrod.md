A second-generation supermutant who wandered eastward in search of a cure for his disabled mind. Nimrod's companion quest should be about attempting to heal the damage caused to his brain by the FEV.

A slave working in the Enclave's Mariposa excavation project, Nimrod was mutated into a second-generation supermutant after exposure to FEV. Nimrod escaped with other mutants during Melchior's revolt. 

Nimrod never retained his previous memories, but he knew something bad had happened to him at Mariposa. His interactions with first-generation supermutants who were much more articulate and clever only cemented this belief and began his journey eastward looking for someone who could help him. 

Nimrod's journey took him through the route remnants of the Master's Army fled, meeting tribal shamans and wasteland doctors who he sought assistance from but were unable to fix the damage caused by the FEV. Eventually Nimrod drifted to the Corridor Wasteland, hoping the advanced medicine of the Cheyennites might cure him. 

On his trip north, Nimrod spotted several figures on patrol in the infamous black armor of the Enclave. He decided that since the Enclave was involved in his transformation, they might be able to fix him. He followed the group to Fort Columbia and after a brief stand-off he met the leader of the Sons of Columbia, the Chief. 

After talking with Nimrod, the Chief offered food, shelter, and medical study from the Colorado State University facilities if he stayed and helped the group. Nimrod agreed and was tasked with diving into irradiated military bases to recover weapons and equipment for the SoC. 

Nimrod's companion quest should be concerning his desire to fix his damaged intellect. Since FEV exposure is permanent, the solution should be about finding a workaround to this problem. Nimrod could either become the subject of experimental nootropic drugs, becoming more capable at the cost of a lower quality of life and chemical dependency. Another solution is Nimrod can find an AI to do his thinking for him. And finally, Nimrod can have his companion quest resolved by being convinced to simply live the best life he can as he is.
