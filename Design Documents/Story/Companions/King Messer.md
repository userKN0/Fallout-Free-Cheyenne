Overview:

A vault dweller who became a wasteland hero in his own time before becoming the Marshal of Free Cheyenne and then retiring to a quiet life. Messer itches for another adventure to satisfy his desire for a return to his youthful days.


Life:

King Messer left Vault 34 with the Boomers in 2231. Instead of sticking with the main force, Messer went off in search of adventure, wandering into northern Arizona. His first escapade involved linking up with the Arizona Rangers to help protect people from raiders. He eventually became dissatisfied with the organization due to its inability and unwillingness to commit itself to providing stability to the wasteland. 

The Arizona Rangers confused Messer. He perceived many of its members as adrenaline junkies who enjoyed fighting and killing, unable to understand why the Rangers never held territory or why they were content to let these so-called savages develop communities in their own way. 

Messer would end up in the employment of the Chamber of Commerce, the oligarchic government of Flagstaff. The missions that the chamber tasked Messer with included undermining the criminal elements in and around Flagstaff that threatened public safety, since unsafe conditions discouraged business and trade. The tasks that were initially about protecting the residents of Flagstaff gradually morphed into defeating the political opposition to the Chamber. 

Messer continued to assist the Chamber and compromised on his values, believing that at the end of the day the Chamber would provide a better solution to the problems of the wasteland than the Rangers or local residents of Flagstaff could. By 2239, the Chamber had won their power struggle, however Messer found he had no place in the society he helped create and decided to wander further east for purpose.

He ended up in Window Rock, the capital of the First Nations Confederacy. He spent two years there, helping to try and negotiate ceasefires between secessionist militias and the government. However, after the breakdown of the first ceasefire, he realized that it was not possible for him to single-handedly solve all of the problems of the confederacy. This, combined with the comparative stability of the confederacy, led him to wander east again. 

After many years roaming the wastes, helping settlements and mediating disputes between tribes along the way, King Messer came to Free Cheyenne and discovered the Marshal Service. Similar to the Arizona Rangers, but directly involved with the local power brokers in the governance of the city, Messer believed he found the answer to his desire for adventure and justice. He settled down, joined as a deputy. Thanks to his experience, within a few years he was appointed Marshal of Free Cheyenne by the city council. King Messer's story takes place at the tail end of his adventure, a foil to a Player character who is only starting their journey. While he has achieved more than most people could ever hope, he is still unsatisfied and wants one more journey to bring closure to choices he greatly regrets.
