Life

Emily Sabine’s life is defined by the hardship of the Sabines. The first 18 years of her life saw the Sabines lose a war, their land, their leader and most of their tribe. Now, she sees them losing their independence. The Sabine leaders had, at every time an inflection point was reached, called for more hardship at the cost of keeping the tribe together and free. Now that the Sabine Exodus is over and the allure of a prosperous life in Free Cheyenne approaches, she views that as almost erasing the need for those hardships to have ever occurred. Emily’s view of the Sabine hardship is heavily romanticized. As far as she’s concerned, the hardship was when the Sabines were the most together, and now, the Sabines are starting to split apart and become “less-Sabine-like”.

  

Emily Sabine was born in 2261, to a prominent traiteur (faith-healer). At the age of five, the Acadian Tributary rebelled. At the age of seven, the Treadheads burned down the Sabines’ ancestral forests. At the age of eight, the Exodus began. At the age of ten, Coozan Augustin died, and the Sabines struggled in Oklahoma. At the age of 14, the Sabines begin preparations for crossing the Cauldron. At the age of 16, her father died, shortly after passing on the faith-healing traditions. At the age of 18, they finally arrived in the Corridor Wasteland.

  

Emily Sabine works as a modern traiteuse at the Cheyenne Medical Complex. She helps with the production of Rad-B-Gone and experimentation regarding Hadacure. She is a bit out of her element due to her general unfamiliarity with modern and pre-war drugs, and illiteracy. She is recognized as a keen diagnostician and pathologist.

  

Emily Sabine is deeply unhappy with her current job, believes that the Corridor Wasteland has failed to live up to the Promised Land ideal that the Followers had given them, is deeply concerned that Caesar’s Legion will annihilate Free Cheyenne and the Sabines with them, and that the Sabine way of life is coming to an end.
