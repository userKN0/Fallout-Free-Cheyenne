Animal companion. Wastewolf that can be encountered in the Rocky Mountains caught in a bear trap. Once freed, she'll leave the area but return to the player after 24 hours to be recruited.

Bella the Wastewolf is descended from the War Wolves, a US bioweapon initiative that was contracted to CHROMAX Genetics. Before the war, Vault-Tec acquired specimens of the warwolves to place in Vault 57 to participate in the canine pack social experiment. Eventually the dwellers left the vault with their specific packs and formed two distinct communities, one in Denver and one in Granby. 

The Granby community and the warwolves developed a symbiotic relationship in this extended pack. The warwolves, which would be come to be known as wastewolves, would hunt and keep the territory free of interlopers. The Granby community treated the injured, maintained shelter, and helped care for the young. 

Bella, during one of her hunts, gets caught in a bear trap and has to be freed. Her companion quest should be finding the person responsible for setting traps to kill the wastewolves.
