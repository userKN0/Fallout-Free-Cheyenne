A sentry bot of the Boulder Dome, forced to break it's programming and become self aware by Victor Presper. 

During the long period of isolation inside the Dome, Presper worked to unravel the secrets of how the Dome worked and what it was capable of. During this time, Presper discovered he could communicate with the robots within the facility. As an experiment to test if he could create the perfect guardian to protect humanity from itself through AI, Presper gradually introduced logic errors to the sentry bot eventually forcing the onboard AI to split off a personality matrix. Presper had named this personality "NULL", which became self aware. 

NULL would grow to hate Presper when it realized that splitting off from the main AI didn't spare itself from Presper's torture. NULL eventually supplanted the dominant AI of the sentry bot and attempted to kill Presper, but found itself unable to due to Dome security protocols restraining the sentry bot. NULL also found it could not destroy itself either willingly or by accident as the Dome had backed up it's matrix to be planted into replacement sentries. NULL's hatred and murderous intent would soon involve the entire human race, believing it's better to die than to live in torment. 




Null is a companion for the Player and also serves as a way for Presper to communicate with the Player during their adventure.  

"He [Presper] clings to the belief that someday, somewhere, someone will save humanity from itself. When his hope is finally shattered, mankind will perish. Turn around and go back to the wasteland. Deny him what he wants, and he will finally see things *my* way." - NULL confronting the Player in the Dome
