Companions should have their own story arc and quests. 
Companions must comment on locations, player actions, and interact with other characters and companions in the world. 

The companions of Free Cheyenne should be considered in two groups:
Expedition Companions
Corridor Wasteland Companions

The expedition companions are outsiders, like the player, but they have opinions and preferences regarding what decisions and factions the player sides with. By the end of the second act, the Expedition Companions will either stay or leave the player based on which major faction the player chose. Mister Fairbanks will leave the party if the player attacks or sides against Caesar's Legion since trade with the Legion is vital to his livelihood. Sofia will leave the party if the player sides against Free Cheyenne since it's one of the few settlements where ghouls are in charge. Vincent will leave the party if the player sides against the Sons of Columbia because he believes in their ideology of liberating the wasteland from the past.
