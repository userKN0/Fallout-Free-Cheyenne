OVERVIEW

The ghoulified wife of the late Captain William B. Cody, the founder and first leader of Free Cheyenne.

For almost 200 years, Jessica Cody has been cementing her late husband's legacy in everything about Free Cheyenne, and as a consequence, amassed enormous political influence despite not holding office. Her goals can be summarized as wanting to see William Cody's face carved into Mount Rushmore next to the other four presidents of the United States. Thanks to her influence with Cody's old friends and surviving officers, she's basically the leader of the Old Guard of Free Cheyenne. Now with an existential threat at their doorstep, Mrs. Cody sees in opportunity to finally fulfill the Captain's legacy that had been out of her grasp for centuries: unify the territories under Free Cheyenne into a federalized state that will one day become the new United States of America. 

She isn't without opponents, however, as Isaac Lang who runs the Platte Trading Company sees the future of Free Cheyenne in economic power and expansion through the PTC rather than in nation building.
