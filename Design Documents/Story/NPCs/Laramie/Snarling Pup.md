Learned the ropes of the butchery business in Free Cheyenne and came to Laramie six years ago to open a slaughterhouse business, primarily selling dog meat but also other cuts of animal when he can find them. Speaks very limited English, but has unquestioned intelligence. Presently does contract work for Nathan Morse, including feeding dead bodies to his dogs.
