- Rocky Mountain Arsenal leaks
- US Army pledges construction of the Boulder Dome as a “City of the Future”

c 2060
- Boulder Dome is completed

2074
- United States Space Administration commissions the Space Relay Constellation research prototype as part of the Mars Shot Project. The SRC station is intended to optimise transportation for interplanetary travel. Thanks to its proximity to the Boulder Dome and Colorado State University, the SRC prototype is constructed at 40 feet deep in the Horsetooth Reservoir near Fort Collins. 

2075
- Robert Dillinger, waiting on death row, has his brain removed and placed into a Robobrain. CODE memory wiping fails, but Robert plays the part and passes inspection. 
- Robert the Robot is sent to Fort Carson to act as a guard for the POW camp and assist government researchers in unethical experiments on prisoners. 
- Fearing communist infiltration and sabotage to their plans, the Enclave begin implementing tighter and tighter security for the Boulder Dome and CSU. Boulder Dome personnel are given passkeys linked to their biometric data to prevent theft. CSU facilities are locked down to outsiders and researchers are terrorised by government agents to prove their loyalty. 

2077
- September: The President of the United States signs Executive Order 99066, allowing the mass internment of Chinese-American civilians. The Think Tank is given authorization to use any of these interned for human experimentation. This triggers a wave of protests from many of the technicians at the facility. 
- October 9th: The "Road Warriors" mechanized battalion receives orders to be recalled to Fort Carson. Rumors begin that they are supposed to be redeployed to the frontlines in China. 
- October 11th: Captain William Cody and several officers become convinced the US Army wants to get them killed in China to cover up the unit activities in Canada. Cody with just over three hundred soldiers stage a mutiny while enroute to Denver and escape to the Wind River Mountains. 
- October 20th: A number of technicians break out of the Big Mountain Research and Development Complex. They bring with them scores of records involving human experimentation, unethical experiments and abuses of power; and a mobile terminal that controls linkup with one of Big MT’s satellites. They publicize the horrors that went on in Big MT. The U.S. government is unable to respond due to the collapse of order throughout the entire country.
- October 23rd: The Great War 
- The defecting technicians at the Big Mountain Research and Development Complex make camp in Death Valley. The walls of the valley protect most of them from radioactive fallout. Fully aware that if the knowledge they gathered at Big MT is lost, then the post-war civilizations might one day repeat the same mistakes. They develop an almost religious devotion to preventing the loss of knowledge from coming to pass, even as many of the technicians die from poor survival skills.
- With Fort Carson coming under bombardment, Robert the Robot takes the opportunity to get revenge by killing researchers and personnel attempting to flee to the bunkers. Robert ultimately survives and escapes.
- CSU Foothills Campus is directly hit due to housing strategic laboratories, engineering facilities, energy infrastructure, and an airfield. Instead of sheltering in place, CSU faculty and students rush home when the nuclear war starts. 
- The Choppers, a Pre-War motorcycle gang turned raiders numbering in the hundreds, find themselves as the most powerful post-War raider group in the Corridor Wasteland. For years, they raid up and down the I-76 and the I-25.
- December: A roving band of military deserters, led by Cpt. Henry Rodriguez, from the Hopeville Military Base enter the Death Valley. They encounter the surviving technicians from Big MT. Rodriguez takes pity on them. Rodriguez, who had heard both their broadcast and Roger Maxson’s broadcast, is convinced that their knowledge needs to survive in the post-war world. Rodriguez begins teaching the technicians rudimentary survival skills, allowing them to prosper in the valley.

2078
- 50% of the Road Warriors who mutinied die within the first year from various causes. Cody keeps the group together with plans of bringing the "real" America back from the ashes.
- Ghoulification becomes observable on some of the members of the Road Warriors. 

2085
- The technicians in Death Valley suffer a calamity. The sole computer that houses the information about Big MT and Mariposa breaks down. The technicians are unable to maintain the satellite linkup terminal that allows them to maintain contact with Rodriguez and the technical information on the same drive. One of the technicians, possessing an eidetic memory, rewrites all of the information on the terminal by hand and teaches the technicians, the deserters and their children all of the knowledge he possesses. Most of the children are dyslexic, so he instead focuses on rote memorization. He is remembered in Cipher history as “Nemonik”.

2086
- Surviving soldiers of the Road Warriors begin Cody's plan to take back America. They leave Wind River Mountain for Cheyenne. 
- The Road Warriors capture Cheyenne. National Guardsmen and inhabitants who resisted are slaughtered. 
- Cody declares the establishment of Free Cheyenne and takes to the airwaves, calling on all patriots and surviving soldiers to revolt against the United States Government in a "Second American Revolution". 
- The Marshal Service of Free Cheyenne is established. 
- Nemonik dies before he can teach his students how to write. Most of the deserters in Death Valley remember the application of his technical information, but not the scientific theory behind it. In addition, his warnings of the places of great evil become corrupted over time. Big MT is remembered as both the “Big Empty” and “Farm of Souls”. While Mariposa is remembered as Mariposa, FEV becomes the “Fev blight”. 
- The Choppers launch a raid on Free Cheyenne, shortly after its foundation. They are driven back by the Road Warriors’ mechanized vehicles and power armor, but a significant number of the city’s civilians are killed or captured.

2087
- Free Cheyenne Marshals tentatively scout the nearby cities and towns in Power Armor. Fort Collins survivors believe the US government has come back to save them and beg for food and water. The Road Warriors realise the USA is gone and take in the survivors.  
- The Road Warriors come to terms with the fact that the war devastated the country so thoroughly that there is no longer a federal government to revolt against. Cody creates a Revolutionary Committee entirely made up of Road Warriors and pivots to planning a campaign to capture Washington, D.C.

2088
- In search of access to clean drinking water, the Road Warriors encounter the Hogbacks tribe who live along Horse Creek. In exchange for gifts of food, medicine, and ammunition, the Hogbacks promise safe passage for Cheyennites to obtain water. 
- Cpt. Rodriguez sends his last report to Death Valley. He states that all attempts to find suitable locations for storing the knowledge have failed. He states that Bloomfield, Los Alamos and Big Mountain were all impossible to enter. He states although the Navajo agreed to try and store some of the knowledge, they could make no guarantees due to the worsening situation outside the reservation borders. He does state that he has found information at a Greenway terminal about a place called “The Nursery”, itself connected to a “Boulder Dome”. He states that information there indicates if an entire city could have survived there, then he could persuade the people to avoid making the mistakes of the Old World when they begin again. Shortly after this, the satellite uplink terminal suffers a power surge and breaks. The technicians are unable to repair it without spare parts, but do manage to make it dormant. Cipher history records that the Boulder Dome is “The Zero”, where society can begin again from nothing. When Rodriguez’s troops divided into the zero, they were erased from this earth.

2089 
- Cpt. Rodriguez’s expedition reaches Colorado. His troops winter in the Mesa Verde National Park, with the goal of gathering new supplies for the march to the north. Some of his troops behind, with the goal of keeping the knowledge in a non-scientific location in the event that Boulder Dome is also uninhabitable. It is also meant to be a supply base that they can pass through on their return journey from Boulder Dome. 
- After the failure of Cpt. Rodriguez’s expedition, the unit that stayed behind in Mesa Verde, continues to live a more naturalistic lifestyle. Many of them can read and write, so they work to continue recording knowledge of Big MT, Mariposa and Boulder Dome. Over time, they become the base for a new tribe, the Flat Tops, derived from the meaning of “Mesa” and the buzz cuts their troops wear.
- The stockpile of fuel that the Choppers possess runs out. Without the fuel to continue raiding, the Choppers decide to abandon motorized raids along the I-25. They stockpile their motorcycles at the Colorado National Speedway and devote themselves to continue caring for them. To prevent their love of motorcycles being forgotten in the younger generations, the older members beat the knowledge into them. Over time, this becomes worship of motorcycles and machinery. This is the functional birth of the “Speed Freaks” tribe. Their obsession with speed and precision motivates them to continue to be skilled, lightning-fast raiders.

2090
- The River Wars begin: the new tribal chieftain of the Hogbacks, Horner, rescinds the initial deal and demands double tribute for safe access to water. Cody refuses to accept and demands a return to previous agreement. Horner orders attacks on Cheyennites who come to Horse Creek for water.
- Cpt. Rodriguez’s troops manage to find the location of Boulder Dome, but are killed when they pass too close to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. Several of the terminals regarding the knowledge are picked up by Free Cheyenne Marshals searching for military equipment to help defend the city better.

2091
- The Hogbacks are no match for the firepower and Power Armor the Marshals inherited from the US military and are utterly defeated. They are forced to sign a humiliating peace treaty that makes them leave Horse Creek and settle 100 miles north. 
- The Marshal Service establishes it's first outpost at Horse Creek.
- William Cody, the leader of the Road Warriors and founder of Free Cheyenne, dies from cancer.

2167
- Arroyo is founded

2168
- The River Wars end: Free Cheyenne gains complete control over the North Platte River and 90% of the remaining waterways in Wyoming. Tribal nomadism in Wyoming effectively ends while sedentary communities thrive from trade.
- The Followers of the Apocalypse send an expedition to determine if the Hoover Dam is still functional. Along the way to the Old Mormon Fort, they encounter the technicians in Death Valley. By now, the technicians have tribalized. Their language, full of numbers and mathematical concepts, is almost incomprehensible to the Followers. When some of the Followers begin work on translation, they realize that the tribe’s obsession with numbers indicates a very advanced understanding of mathematics and that the tribe must be speaking in code. This leads to the technicians being given the name “Ciphers”.

2169
- With the River Wars concluded, Free Cheyenne begins to develop exploitation of surrounding cities and towns. Salvagers strip down useful junk and intact building materials to be sent back to Free Cheyenne for profit. A salvager colony is established in Fort Collins.

2170
- The Followers of the Apocalypse discover the Hoover Dam is still intact. 

2173
- The Flat Tops make contact with The Reservation. They establish relations on the basis of mutual defense against the Guardians of the Old Order.

Within a year, the Flat Tops join the anti-Guardians alliance with The Reservation and the Rocketmen.

2175
- The Followers of the Apocalypse successfully crack the Ciphers’ language and realize that their language and history have revealed a rich library of pre-war knowledge, scientific locations and technical knowledge. The Followers successfully persuade a group of the Ciphers to come to the west to form the Abbey of Lost Knowledge. Most of the Ciphers stay behind in Death Valley, living their naturalistic and rural life.

2181
- The Fort Collins salvage colony reaches its peak at 100 people.

- The Speed Freaks attempt to voluntarily join the Midwestern Brotherhood of Steel, as their Power Armor makes them appear as “machine man”. The Brotherhood envoy to Firestone requests that the Speed Freaks turn over their holy artifacts, the motorcycles, for repair. The Speed Freaks refuse. In the ensuing argument, 34 Speed Freaks are killed before they can drive the Brotherhood envoy out in the resulting firefight. The Speed Freaks view the Brotherhood as the ultimate evolution of machinery and remember this interaction as proof of what machine-like perfection can be.

2200
- The Midwestern Brotherhood empire reaches it's peak, stretching from Vault 0 to Chicago.
