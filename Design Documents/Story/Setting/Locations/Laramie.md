OVERVIEW

Laramie is a pre-war town that suffered extensively from the Great War. The bomb that struck the nearby National Guard base devastated the town. Much of the urban area has been rebuilt with fresh timber. Laramie is the gateway between Free Cheyenne and the rest of western Wyoming. As a result of this, the town is bustling with travelers and cargo heading both west and east. 

The constant flux of people has turned the settlement into den of vice. Booze, sex, and entertainment are all available to the company men of the Platte Trading Company and other travelers who are quite often flush with cash. The focal point of all this is the Jewel Tavern and has led to it's owner, Nathan Morse, accumulating an unhealthy amount of power in the town. 

The town is aligned with Free Cheyenne, but is being terrorized by corrupt leadership. The three Morse Brothers: Nathan the saloon owner, Owen the mayor, and Landon the sheriff, are chasing local farmers off their land to buy at rock bottom prices and then selling it to people leaving Free Cheyenne to escape a potential Legion invasion. 

The Morse Brothers don't rule without opposition. A vigilante group known as the Laramie Citizens Alliance want to see the criminal trio hang for their crimes. Holding meetings from a church basement outside of town, the concerned citizens hope to bring the Morse Brothers down and have the Marshals of Free Cheyenne return. 

Gameplay wise, Laramie is the first major location the Player is expected to arrive in while following the main quest. The town has merchants, potential player housing, and a doctor.

Bathhouse - Laramie Public Bathhouse is a rest stop for weary travelers and locals to clean up, do laundry, and even socialize. The ground floor was initially built to accommodate Marshals passing through as well as the largely male workforce of the caravans which eventually would become the PTC. However, as time went on more and more women required their own facilities and the basement was eventually converted to allow segregated bathing areas. Player characters will have access to areas of the bathhouse depending on their sex. 

Grand Avenue Stables - Stable for pack animals owned by Jerry Stout.

Laramie Assay and Evaluations - Along with measuring the value of ore, wasteland assayers judge the value of salvage that a scavenger may come across. The particular location in Laramie is owned by Mickey Winkler who is in league with the Morse Brothers. Together, they scheme to rip off anyone who comes in for a valuation and to locate the sites of valuable deposits of minerals and salvage that a prospector might come across. Nathan Morse justifies this arrangement as the prospectors can either get cheated by the PTC or by a "small business owner" like himself.

Edith Young - The de facto leader of the Laramie Citizens Alliance. Once a former bounty hunter employed by the Platte Trading Company, she settled down to run the town boarding house. She wants to use the Morse Brothers in a good ol'-fashioned shootout, but is too old to do so.
