A small settlement that sits on one of the few routes through the Cauldron. While sitting on the edge of the Cauldron itself, the small community is also caught between the warring remnant factions of the Midwestern Brotherhood: the True Brotherhood, the Unity of Steel, and the Provisional Brotherhood of Steel. 


OVERVIEW
Pine Bluffs, like many small towns in America, avoided outright destruction during the Great War. However, the decades following the nuclear apocalypse took their toll. The war devastated the Great Plains, turning it into an enormous dust bowl that locals would come to call the Cauldron. With exception to a handful rivers that could facilitate travel, the Cauldron acted as a great barrier between the Rockies and the Midwest. 

Pine Bluffs sits at the edge of the Cauldron, constantly under threat of being buried by a dust storm. To make matters worse the Midwestern Brotherhood Civil War still rages out east, occasionally spilling out into the Corridor as skirmishes take place inside the dust bowl.   

Life is hard in Pine Bluffs. Agriculture is nonexistent. Masks to prevent dust pneumonia are required to live here. Pack animals will die if left exposed. The only residents are either salvagers or people directly on the Platte Trading Company payroll. The community lifeline is a single PTC post. For some, this place may as well be hell on earth. For others, Pine Bluff is a gold mine. In spite of the danger, some of the most valuable salvage in the wasteland can be uncovered here. From rare machine parts to pre-war energy cells, the harsh terrain has kept these prizes safe for those brave or foolish enough to look for them.
