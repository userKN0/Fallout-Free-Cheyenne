Temperance is a post-war community developed just outside the ruins of Greeley, Colorado. Greeley before the Great War was a college town, home to the University of Northern Colorado, a small missile warning system at the county airport and a small prisoner of war airport. There were no grand experiments or even much in the way of industrial investment. Its relative importance to the Resource War did not spare it from a direct Chinese hit and collateral damage from the attacks on Fort Collins. For decades after the Great War, Greeley was effectively abandoned as a hostile ghost town.

  

**Timeline

2169 - With the River Wars concluded, Free Cheyenne begins to develop exploitation of surrounding cities and towns. Salvagers strip down useful junk and intact building materials to be sent back to Free Cheyenne for profit. A salvager colony is established in Fort Collins.

2170 - Vault 70 opens in Salt Lake City. The Mormons head north to Ogden, taking shelter with the Lord’s Army of New Canaan. This is considered the true “birth” of New Canaan.

2171 - A salvager colony is established in Greeley, Colorado. The colony is not particularly valuable, as Greeley had very little in the way of Pre-War loot. What the community does have is surprisingly fertile soil and a good climate for growing potatoes, apples, wheat and corn. 

2181 - The Fort Collins salvage colony reaches its peak at 100 people.

2185 - New Canaan begins sending envoys east along the I-80 for trade, religious conversion and resource gathering purposes. Their journey is relatively stable due to the coming a full decade after the River Wars. They encounter the Witt Estate and Free Cheyenne.

2187 - New Canaan signs trade alliances with the Witt Estate and Free Cheyenne. Mormon missionaries are granted the freedom of passage in exchange for an agreement to share survivalist skills and technical knowledge. Some of these missionaries travel to Greeley.

2191 - Vault 40 in Estes Park opens. The Vault Marauders drive wastelanders and whole communities off the mountain over the next few decades. Greeley takes on most of the Fort Collins salvage colony’s members and the pastoralist tribals that did not get enslaved by the Marauders.

2199 - The Vault Colony is established in Estes Park, Colorado. 

2200 - The Vault Marauders launch an aggressive attack on the Greeley salvage colony but are driven back by its coalition of Mormons, tribals, salvagers and hired Free Cheyenne Marshals. The Marauders decide to back off and regroup in Estes Park. Greeley cements itself as one of the few settlements who can stand up to the Marauders, although raids on Greeley’s caravans and salvage continue to occur.

2204 - The Platte River Monopoly Act is passed, establishing the Platte Trading Company and its monopoly over all trade in the Wyoming territory for the next 99 years.

2209 - The Platte Trading Company signs an agreement for a trading post in Greeley.

2230 - The last salvage colony family leaves Fort Collins. The Vault Marauders reach the zenith of their control, raiding from Estes Park to Fort Collins to Longmont to Granby.

2236 - The mayor of Greeley comes up with a new strategy in dealing with the Vault Marauders. He convinces one of their prisoners to send an envoy to the Marauders’ mysterious overseer. In exchange for supplying the Marauders with salvage and alcohol, the Marauders would no longer raid Greeley itself. The overseer agrees, and the two groups agree to form a “neutral ground” at Longmont. The Platte Trading Company protests but ultimately agrees to observe total neutrality in Longmont, even operating a small, under-the-table trading post there.

2246 - The Midwestern Brotherhood’s civil war begins.

2247 - Caesar’s Legion is founded.

2249 - Echo Company establishes itself in the ruins of Colorado State University in Fort Collins. New Canaan suffers a severe political crisis, culminating in the religious fundamentalist group the Hands of God attacking caravans along the I-80.

-With the Hands of God attacking caravans across the I-80, many travelers decide to continue further west to begin reclaiming the Wasteland. Much of the land in Wyoming along the I-80 is not arable, and they are forced to continue further east in search of better land. 

2250 - At Fort Collins, Echo Company realizes something has gone when their vertibird fails to return two weeks after their anticipated rendezvous. The team is now stranded in Colorado.

2250 - The Army of Vengeance invades Arizona. The Desert Rangers open a new supply route to the NCR through New Canaan. Rangers are sent north to Utah to protect this supply line.

2251 - Echo Company has its first encounter with Vault Marauders. The troopers annihilate the raiders, causing them to avoid Fort Collins permanently. The Vault 40 overseer shuns Echo Company’s outpost as a location harmful to its chosen.

-With Fort Collins now becoming a barrier to Vault Marauders’ attacks from the west, Greeley continues to grow and flourish, slowly becoming the breadbasket of the Corridor Wasteland. The migration of settlers, farmers, caravaneers and New Canaanites effectively reaches its end.

2252 - The Free Cheyenne Marshals notice the absence of Vault Marauders in the Fort Collins area and investigate. Contact is established between Echo Company and Free Cheyenne. Learning that Fort Collins is safe from raiders, wastelanders and tribals from Wyoming gradually filter into the ruined city and begin to trade with soldiers of Echo Company.

-New Canaan stabilizes under the leadership of Bishop Mordecai. The New Canaanite caravans begin operating again, and the Hands of God have largely been neutralized as a coherent fighting force. This reopens trade between New Canaan and Free Cheyenne.

2253 - A new mayor of Greeley, a more moralist type, decides to take full advantage of the decline of the Vault Marauders and openly breaks their agreement with them, going so far as to ban the production, sale and consumption of any and all chems in Greeley territory. However, the Vault Marauders have not actually weakened that much, and they begin raiding Greeley’s food shipments all across Colorado State Highway 85 and manage to kill Greeley’s mayor. This renewed activity aggravates both Free Cheyenne and Fort Collins, and they agree to jointly come to Greeley’s aid in exchange for a significant food surplus.

-The Vault Marauders are defeated at Berthoud by a combined alliance of Fort Collins, Greeley and Free Cheyenne. Although the Marauders are defeated, the alliance breaks down almost immediately due to Granite’s distrust of mutants and opposition to the Platte Trading Company. Temperance barely manages to make the food shipments to the two powers as agreed, with a harsh winter nearly destroying everything. The new mayor, in commemoration of surviving war and famine, renames the town “Temperance”.

2256 - The Daughters of Hecate are founded.

2264 - New Canaan, Jericho, the Desert Rangers, the Crazy Horns, the Eagle Rock and the Tar Walkers form a loose military alliance against the various raider groups in Utah, starting with the Bone Dancers.

2268 - The Bone Dancers are broken as an organization by the New Canaan-Rangers-tribal alliance. The White Legs emerge as a more aggressive tribe that annexes the Bone Dancers, but they are still contained by this new alliance.

-This leads to a golden age of trade between the NCR, New Canaan and Free Cheyenne. Temperance continues to grow, its ban on alcohol becoming entrenched through trade with New Canaanite caravans that refuse to do business with anyone other than teetotalers. In addition, hundreds of NCR citizens from northern California, unable to deal with the rising power of the Brahmin Barons or the high crime of New Reno, and unwilling to convert to Mormonism; begin traveling east en masse specifically to settle Temperance, viewing it as “the last great frontier”.

2271 - The Ranger Unification Treaty is signed. The NCR pulls the Desert Rangers west. The New Canaan-Rangers-tribal alliance collapses, leading to a resurgence of the 80s and the White Legs along the I-80 and the I-15. The Legion allies with the Dead Horses as a proxy.

-This produces a surplus of crops in the Corridor Wasteland as exports to the West decline due to the instability. By now, Temperance has cemented itself as the breadbasket of the Corridor Wasteland.

2272 - The Salt Lake Trading Union is formed in Utah. They become the new major buyer of food from Temperance.

2275 - Bishop Mordecai leads a disastrous expedition to Vault 70. All but five are killed, and he enters a deep depression.

2276 - The Colorado Campaign begins. Lanius marches north to conquer Denver.

2277 - Refugees from Caesar's Legion's conquests begin to pour into Free Cheyenne. The Free Cheyenne Council imposes a total embargo on all trade with Caesar's Legion. Trade Regulators are ordered to destroy Platte Trading Company property in Colorado before it can fall into the hands of the advancing Legion.

2277 - The NCR makes serious efforts to rebuild the trade connection with the I-15 in response to the Battle of the Divide. The NCR makes serious efforts to improve the supply line between New Canaan, the Salt Lake Trading Union and the NCR. This causes exports of food from Temperance to dramatically increase.

2277 - The Colorado Campaign is beset with brutality and violence, and even significant amounts of desertion. A dozen or so Legionaries break free and request refuge with Temperance. The council agrees provided that they fully renounce their loyalty to Caesar.

2279 - Lanius conquers the Hangdogs and secure control of Denver, a victory in the Colorado Campaign. 

2280 - Denver is partially stabilized under the leadership of Ferrarius. Slave demand increases, and the Legion, needing to rebuild its food supply in the face of the Free Cheyenne embargo, begins taking slaves en masse.

2280 - Decimus survives an encounter with Joshua Graham and flees, settling in the town of Temperance.

2281 - New Canaan is destroyed by the White Legs. Trade throughout Utah is severely disrupted. Temperance is deeply concerned about Legion activities in Utah and to the south and begins stockpiling huge amounts of food.
