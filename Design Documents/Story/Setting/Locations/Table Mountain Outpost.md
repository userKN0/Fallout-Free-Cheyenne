Just south of the Wyoming-Colorado border is Table Mountain, a strategic location that overlooks the main routes from the Rocky Mountains to southern Wyoming. The Marshals of Free Cheyenne hold an outpost on top of Table Mountain preventing the Vault Marauders from attacking the I-80 route to Laramie. 



Notable NPCs:

(Supervisory) Senior Deputy Marshal Dupont - Marshal Sharpshooter, stationed at Table Mountain and in charge of the outpost. Unlike many snipers who attempt to create an air of mystique and intimidation around themselves, Dupont enjoys talking and telling stories to people he meets. He doesn't need to put on a show like he's tough because he knows he's the best.
