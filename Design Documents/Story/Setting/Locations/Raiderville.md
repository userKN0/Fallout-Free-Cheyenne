Formerly known as Longmont, Raiderville is a settlement that is a neutral ground for all factions. It serves as an economic hub for raider groups, being a marketplace for stolen goods, chems, and even captives.

OVERVIEW
With the growth of Free Cheyenne and it's economic might so too did the rise of banditry. Tribes, people displaced by the River Wars, and ordinary wastelanders turned to highway robbery and raiding at one point or another as a means of surviving when all other options were untenable. Eventually, these groups found the need to trade and sell their ill-gotten gains with others (or in some cases their original owners). Thus, Longmont became the favourite ground for these ventures. Close enough to the mountain hideouts of road pirates and Moonrunners, but also within reach of Highwaymen and Manhunters. And over the years Longmont would gain the infamous moniker of "Raiderville". 

Raiderville has no central leadership, governing body, or permanent residents. The ruined city operates on an unwritten code that all visitors abide:
- No killing
- No stealing
- No cheating

However, outside the city, everything is considered fair game. 

The popular commodities of Raiderville are stolen cargo, chems, and captives. Every faction in the Corridor Wasteland has done business in there. Legionaries from Denver sometimes make the trip to purchase slaves. On rare occasions, people even from Free Cheyenne can be spotted arriving to pay a ransom. 

Despite it's enduring legacy as a truly neutral ground in the wasteland, time is running out for Raiderville as it lies right in the middle of the coming war between Free Cheyenne and Caesar's Legion.
