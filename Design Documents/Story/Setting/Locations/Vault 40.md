The vault and main base of operations for the Vault Marauders. The facility is home to ZAX-40, the Overseer of the vault and leader of the Vault Marauders. The vault experiment for Vault 40 was to test the absolute limits of ZAX in performing crisis management and civil control, with the data ultimately to be used to manage space colonies. With many systems, devices, and protocols intentionally engineered by Vault-Tec to fail in order to test ZAX and the prime directive being the survival of the vault population, ZAX-40 came to the conclusion that the vault inhabitants were incapable of surviving with the resources at hand and directed the vault dwellers to become raiders.
