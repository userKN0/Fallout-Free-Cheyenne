Boulder Dome is a model "city of the future" meant to be used for space colonization. The facility went silent after the Great War and only ever opened when an NCR expedition arrived in 2269. The Boulder Dome holds the capacity for an entire city inside itself, completely self sufficient and able to withstand anything up to a direct nuclear attack. Being a US Army project, the Dome is also a complete arsenal of weaponry and production from small arms to NBC to ensure it's own defense. The Dome's only resident is Victor Presper, the last surviving member of the original NCR expedition. 

The exterior of the Boulder Dome is more like a sphere. The mountain it was built into was blown away by nuclear bombardment.
