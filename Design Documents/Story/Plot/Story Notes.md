Ideas for the overarching plot of Fallout: Free Cheyenne


The recurring idea for the Fallout series is that "war never changes." So what would it take to end war and achieve peace in the wasteland? Each faction appears to have a different response to this question: Free Cheyenne believes in prosperity to resolve conflict, the Legion believes in a brutality so fierce that the opponent would never dare to raise their fist again, the Sons of Columbia believe an end to history and a dedication to the future would end war.

Victor Presper wants to save humanity from itself and believes the threat of annihilation would stop it. But the nagging problem of this solution is that it denies free will. Through the Player, Presper devises the ultimate social experiment: will the common man choose Truth or Power for humanity. 

Presper can't fight the Player to achieve his goal. He has to convince the Player that his plan of using the Boulder Dome to end war is not only achievable, but desirable compared to the alternative which according to him is a series of conflicts with no end and gradual decline of the present factions. 

Peace requires two parties to agree, the Player disagreeing with Presper means that peace, and by consequence his ideology, are impossible to achieve and he is already defeated.  

Presper can't prevent the Battle of the Corridor from occurring for two reasons: one, if he did it before the battle then the faction he betrayed would be able to attack with their full strength. Two, his opponent is the Player who needs to see a war up close in order to understand Presper's perspective. Presper's battle isn't for the land of the wastes like the other factions, it's for the Player.  It's a battle of belief.

An end to war and conflict in a meta sense is an end to the story of Fallout. It calls into question the place for heroes like the Vault Dweller or the Courier if there are no more wars for them to fight. Should a hero seek peace if it means that this new world they create will leave them behind? Is it moral to allow war to continue if it means the hero can have a place in the world?

The faction conflict in Free Cheyenne examines the limits to ideology. NULL as an antagonist is an examination of nihilism. The final confrontation with Presper is the culmination of the battle between Truth and Power (the Player has rejected the Power of the Dome over the entire wasteland in favour of Truth).



The overarching conflict for the Boulder Dome is a Dialectic between Truth and Power, but the underlying theme of the game is Justice which is the synthesis of Truth and Power. Presper acts as the face of Truth, NULL as the face of Power, and the Player Character as the face of Justice (including all the Injustice a Player can commit).



All ideological, philosophical, and religious movements are a Dialectic between Plato vs Aristotle.
