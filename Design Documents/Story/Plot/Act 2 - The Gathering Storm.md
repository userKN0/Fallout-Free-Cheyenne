The Player enters the Boulder Dome alone, as the key obtained from the Ciphers only allows safe entry for those recognized by the security system. They are immediately contacted by the lone resident of the Dome, Victor Presper. 

Presper explains to the Player that the Dome is currently in an emergency lockdown and until it's lifted the many facilities and sectors that would make it valuable are not available. Presper himself cannot do this as he is locked away in a sector designed to protect VIPs and lacks the security level to lift it. However the Player with their newly acquired key has a high enough security level to open up areas and perform necessary tasks to begin ending the emergency lockdown.

Presper's first task is to locate functional ZAX components to bypass the security parameters at the root level. There are multiple places to find these components or quests to complete to receive these items and it'll be up to the Player on how they accomplish this task. 

Upon leaving the Dome for the first time, the Player will meet a squad of soldiers who are part of the Sons of Columbia. They explain the Player has been granted safe passage to enter Fort Columbia to meet their leader, the Chief. 

The Chief explains to the Player who the Sons are, what they want, and how they will achieve it with the Boulder Dome. The Chief wants the Player to continue assisting Presper in bringing the Dome back to functionality but wants them to report back after each task is completed. 

Once the Player has returned from the Dome with the necessary ZAX components, Presper will ask the Player about their actions in the Corridor Wasteland. No matter what option the Player has chosen in previous quests, Presper will challenge the Player on their decision to use violence or seek a peaceful resolution. After he's satisfied or irritated by the Player's response, he will tell the Player to leave the Dome and meet with the visitors outside. 

When the Player leaves the Dome for the second time, the Free Cheyenne Marshals will approach them and say that the leader of Free Cheyenne wishes to meet them. The meeting involves the Chairman of the city council and Jessica Cody, the ghoulified wife of the late William Cody who founded Free Cheyenne in 2086. They ask the Player to work with Free Cheyenne in securing the Dome, explaining the technology and facilities will help them finally overcome the Legion. 

In the Corridor Wasteland, a grey zone formed between the territories of Free Cheyenne and Caesar's Legion where neither side sought to control. In this area, raider tribes filled the power vacuum. Before the Battle of the Corridor can begin for any faction, these raider groups must be dealt with to allow the armies to move freely. The groups include the Vault Marauders, the Freaks, and the Manhunters. Each faction wants a different way to deal with these problems, ultimately up to the discretion of the Player. Free Cheyenne wants these raiders to be neutralized and brought into the fold of their new army to liberate the Corridor from the Legion. The Legate wants them destroyed to make an example of raiders, to deny Free Cheyenne their cannon fodder, and because the Legion garrison is incapable of assimilating them properly. Meanwhile, the Sons of Columbia wants their tribal beliefs shattered and to take up the symbols of the SoC. How closely the Player's outcome matches with these faction goals affects their reputation in the faction. These quests also alternate between working for the major faction and working for Presper.  

The first faction main quest task is to destroy or align the Vault Marauders, the ultimate desired goal depending on the faction. Once completed, they will be sent back to the Dome to assist Presper.

Presper will ask the Player to locate parts to repair the Dome's microwave arrays to allow communication and data transfers with surviving Pre-War infrastructure. This will be necessary for the Dome to access data archives to achieve it's true potential for the faction.  
Once the Player has returned from the Dome with the necessary microwave array components, Presper will install the parts and the Player will be directed to complete the next stage of the coming battle.

The next faction main quest task is to deal with the Manhunters, a cannibal raider tribe that lurks on the edge of the Cauldron.

Upon returning to the Dome, Presper will ask the Player to locate a source of tritium to restart the fusion reactor. 

When the tritium is delivered to the Dome for Presper, the final task is to reboot the entire Boulder Dome system. Presper needs time to prepare for this, so the Player will complete another faction quest prior to the restoration of the Boulder Dome.

The next faction main quest task is to deal with the Freaks, a raider tribe that lives in the center of the Corridor. Destroy or align them, and the path to the Corridor is now open for the coming battle.

Returning to help Presper, the Player is assigned to do 

Upon completion, the Player is sent to conclude their last faction quest before the upcoming battle. 

If the Player has aligned with Free Cheyenne or Caesar's Legion, this quest will be the destruction of the Sons of Columbia. 

If the Player has aligned with the Sons of Columbia, their quest is to aid a revolution against the leadership of Free Cheyenne.


With this faction main quest complete, the Player will return to the Boulder Dome to aid Presper in the reboot. Once the Player has finished protecting Presper during the process, the Dome becomes fully functional and the Player's aligned faction and companions can enter. With the lockdown over, Presper also becomes available to directly interact with and even kill. 

With the Boulder Dome secured, the Battle of the Corridor begins.
