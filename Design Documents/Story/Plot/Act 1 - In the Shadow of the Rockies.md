Upon leaving Doc Mitchell's house, the Player discovers a letter detailing a job offered by the East Forty Caravan Company. The Player can visit their Mojave headquarters at the 188 Trading Post and meet the president of the company, John Abel. 

Abel explains the job is to join a team to recover a sensitive package that was stolen from a caravan headed east. A group of tribals, identified as the Ciphers, attacked the caravan before it could leave the Mojave and cross into Caesar's land. The Player's job is to recover the item and deliver it to the company's client in Free Cheyenne. 

The Player then goes to the Las Vegas Bay Campground to meet the expedition. The team includes Mister Fairbanks, a caravan boss who is experienced with the east trade routes, Vincent, a former Vault City guard turned gunman, and Sophia, an expert tracker who worked for the Bishops of New Reno. 

The narrative jumps to the team having arrived in the Corridor Wasteland through the Rockies, having made camp in Woods Landing. At this point the Player can go any direction to find the Ciphers in the wasteland, but the trail of clues follows from Laramie to Free Cheyenne to Temperance to Fort Morgan to Denver and finally to Boulder. 

When the Player arrives in Fort Morgan, they discover the entire Cipher camp has been massacred with energy weapons. They find only one survivor, a woman who tells them what they stole, why, and where the leader is going. The Ciphers stole a key to the Boulder Dome from the East Forty Caravan Company. The tribe had been suffering from a poor crop season and was facing starvation until messages from the Boulder Dome begun to communicate with them and promised them a GECK if they could bring the key to the Dome. Two of their men escaped the attack on the camp, their leader and her husband.

In Denver, the Player discovers the husband has been crucified. Upon meeting with the Legate, he explains that the Legion attempted to capture and execute them for attacking the East Forty caravan as it was Legion marked. They failed to capture the Cipher leader, but did manage to wound him.

When the Player finally catches up to the leader of the Ciphers, he's already succumb to his wounds at the hands of the Legionaries. They recover the key and take it to the client in Free Cheyenne. 

Upon entry the Player discovers the client is dead, killed with energy weapons. The Player will also receive a letter from John Abel, explaining he heard of the death of the client shortly after the team left and is giving new instructions. Abel tells the Player to use the key to open the Boulder Dome and get the Legion to occupy the facility. With so many people having died over this key. Abel wants to ensure that nobody will touch the Old World treasures inside the Dome before he and the East Forty Company can get to it. The Legion won't loot the technology they are after, and will deter any attempt to take the Dome by force.

Whether the Player plans to follow through on Abel's plan, Act I concludes when the Player goes to the Dome, activates the key, and enters the facility.
