-To portray an analogue to native tribes for Free Cheyenne.
  

==Real-Life Lore:==

The Cajuns have a long and rich history. The British conquest of Acadia and the Seven Years' War led to many French and French-speaking people who refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the British monarchy moving south. The Acadians made their way south, ending in Spanish Louisiana. The Spanish governor agreed to let them stay, practice their language and settle the lands.

Territory ebbed and flowed until the Cajuns ended up under U.S. control. For the next three centuries, the Cajuns dominated the culture of Louisiana, from its race relations to its music to its food to its religion.


==Timeline:==

c 2150 - The Honilanders are pushed eastward from the Honey Island Swamp and settle on the eastern shores of the Sabine River, giving them the name “Sabines”. They operate over a fairly large stretch of the Calcasieu Parish.

2234 - The Sabines successfully manage to defeat many of the smaller tribes in the Calcasieu Parish. They establish the Acadian Tributary as a puppet state in the ruins of Lafayette. This pushes a number of tribes east.

2266 - The Treadheads, forced from their home in New Orleans by other tribes and drought, attempt to settle the lands of the Sabine River. This brings them into conflict with the Sabines. The Acadian Tributary declares independence from the Sabines, allying with the Treadheads.

2268 - A dispute between the Sabines and the Treadheads over access to fresh water leads to conflict. The Treadheads and their allies burn the Sabine forests down to force the Sabines to flee the territory. The Acadian Tributary voluntarily dissolves.

2269 - The Sabines are forced to leave Louisiana, and begin a ten-year exodus westwards.

2275 - The Sabines learn of the Corridor Wasteland from an expedition of the Followers of the Apocalypse heading east.

2279 - The Sabines cross the Cauldron. They settle in Fort Morgan, Colorado.

2280 - The Sabines join the city of Free Cheyenne, providing military assistance in exchange for protection from Legion slaving parties.


==Game Lore:==

When the bombs fell, Acadiana weathered the crisis better than most. Isolated pockets of uncontaminated swamp, huge tracts of arable land, decades of apocalypse prepping and a history of rugged survivalism led to the Cajun people thriving even in the post-apocalypse.

It wasn't to last. A long history of personal independence, a schism over whether to renounce their American heritage and a general inability to cooperate with each other ultimately culminated in a series of local wars between different Cajun groups. These turf wars became a dominant feature of Louisiana for over two centuries.

The Honilanders, based out in the Honey Island Swamp, were pushed eastward by one of these turf wars in the early 2150s. They trekked their way through hostile wildlife and tribes to eventually settle on the eastern shores of the Sabine River. Eventually, this tribe would become known as the "Sabines", with some even forgetting that they used to be called Honilanders.

The Sabines were a largely hunter-gatherer tribe, operating over a fairly large stretch of the Calcasieu Parish. However, the territory of Louisiana's Neutral Ground proved to be anything but. The turf wars that had driven the Sabines out of Honey Island continued abated.

In 2234, the Sabines successfully managed to defeat most of the smaller tribes and forcibly evicted them from their homes. The Sabines established a subservient Free State of Acadiana, as a sort of reservation of many of those smaller tribes. In doing so, they also displaced a number of tribes already living, breeding resentment against the Sabines. The territory east of New Iberia was massively destabilized. 

In 2266, the Treadheads, a formerly New Orleans-based tribe, was forced out of their territory by a drought and by displaced western Louisiana tribes. They attempted to settle the lands of the Sabine River, bringing them into conflict with the Sabines over control of fresh water. The Free State of Acadiana saw its chance to break the Sabine yoke and allied with the Treadheads.

The Sabines lasted for two years. The Treadheads, even with the support of the Free State of Acadiana, were unable to compete with the Sabines’ firepower or halt their guerrilla actions, chose to burn down the Sabines’ ancestral forests. With the Sabines now without a home, the Sabines went to Treadhead leadership for some sort of peace negotiations. The Treadheads, unwilling to take in the Sabines into their own ranks, bluntly told the Sabines to leave or die.

The Sabines, having made enemies of all surrounding tribes, were left with few allies. Unable to find a new homeland in the swamps of Louisiana, the Sabines faced the prospect of disbanding and integrating with other tribes. 

Coozan Augustin, a prominent Sabine warrior, rallied the Sabines. He promised to keep them together and establish a new Sabine homeland, free of the turf wars that had destroyed them. The Sabines began their exodus west.

The journey was long and harsh. The Sabines traveled through the harshness of the Great Piney Wasteland, Houston and Oklahoma. Everytime, the Sabines found that they were outcompeted by the groups already living there, and everytime they found that the lands were too barren to support them.

The Cauldron ravaged the landscape of Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and the Dakotas, with occasional blowovers east and west of it. Life in Oklahoma was harsh, the death of Coozan Augustin and the constant threat of drought and radiation storms led to the Sabines reaching a new low.

In 2275, a Followers of the Apocalypse expedition from the Wyoming outpost ventured across the Cauldron, his mission being to contact the eastern chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel for the possibility of technology sharing and communications across the continent. He was given refuge at the Sabine camp and told them stories of the general stability that Free Cheyenne and the Corridor Wasteland offered. After two months of learning about their culture, he left for the east, never to be seen by the Sabines again.

The Sabines were rallied once again. The new Sabine elder, Armand Thibodeaux, had a new plan. They were going to cross the Cauldron and push even further west. He again promised to keep them together. For the next three years, the Sabines stockpiled radiation suits, Rad-X and Rad-Away.

The journey across the Cauldron took three months. They suffered a brutal winter, radiation poisoning in spite of their protective gear and starvation. Nearly half of the Sabines died on that march. But, they crossed the Cauldron in 2279 and emerged into the Corridor Wasteland. But, the wasteland was a very different place from when the Followers left.

Caesar’s Legion was in the middle of the Colorado Campaign, the empire of the Midwestern Brotherhood had collapsed, and Free Cheyenne was in political crisis. Nevertheless, the Sabines settled in the town of Fort Morgan, Colorado. Initially, they were left alone, but demand for slaves led to the Legion raiding the Sabines.

Free Cheyenne, desperate for more manpower and impressed by the Sabines’ bravery, extended an offer of mutual protection. The Sabines would be free from the Legion slaving parties in exchange for joining the Free Cheyenne militia. The Sabines agreed. 
  

==Culture:==

The Sabines can best be described as Americanized Cajun tribals. Their language is a base mix of Louisiana French and English, with Spanish loan words from their time in Texas. Ironically, their major bases of operation in both the Honey Island Swamp and along the Sabine River weren’t in Acadiana at all. The only reason the tribe spoke Cajun in the first place was because the Cajuns had so effectively integrated into Louisiana that it had made the Cajun tongue, culture and loan words very common.

The Sabines were primarily nomadic, and generally emphasized shared values of personal independence, southern hospitality and post-racial equality. The Sabines lived a life of cypress tree farming, cocodril farming, and hunting.

Most of the tribes living in Louisiana carried the Bowie knife (invented in Louisiana), and the Sabines were no exception. The Sabines eschewed more advanced energy weapons in favor of ballistic weapons. Many of these guns date back from before the Great War, the legacy of the hundreds of doomsday preppers in the Louisiana wilderness. 

Practically none of the fauna that the Sabines ate - whether it be cocodril, snapper, coypu, dillo, ringtail or hellcat - lives in their newfound home of the Corridor Wasteland. They do have yao guai (they call them “trash devils”, and they are significantly less aggressive) and beavers out east.

  

The Sabines have a work hard, play hard philosophy derived from the “Joie de vivre” (joy of living). The Sabines are generally optimistic about the future, believing that the good times will roll, now more common as the view of finally being able to settle down in a new place is in sight.

  

==Religion & Spirituality:==

The Sabines follow a derivative of Roman Catholic Christianity. The Sabines have a form of consecration by elders, sacrificial bread and wine, veneration of the holy virgin, and mass. They explicitly worship God and his son, Jesus. 

They are, however, largely ignorant of the Bible itself, most written texts being destroyed in the humid air of Louisiana. Because of this, most Sabines never bothered to learn to read or write, adopting an entirely oral-based history and information tracking.

The Sabines are unsure of whether or not the God and Jesus the New Canaanites believe is the same figure, but the discovery of another culture that worships the same figures has led to a spiritual reawakening in the Sabines, with many believing that Free Cheyenne is the promised land.


==Economy:==

The Sabines did not use the bottlecap in Louisiana, due to the massive abundance of freshwater in the area. In fact, they didn’t use currency at all. The Sabines had an almost entirely barter-based economy. Pre-war dollars were used as something the price of goods were pegged to, but the frailty of the dollars meant that they were never used. 

The Sabines were introduced to the bottlecap by the Followers, and resolved to collect as many as they could for their journey west.

One of the major hindrances to their integration into Free Cheyenne is their general failure to understand currency, and the fact that Free Cheyenne doesn’t explicitly pay them in usable currencies, but rather necessities like food, water, guns and ammo.

  
  

==Technology:==

The Sabines focused on tribal, herbal remedies rather than industrial ones. One of the recipes they brought with them is Hadacure, a foul-testing cure-all. Hadacure provides treatments to cough, constipation, nausea, insomnia, dizziness, blurred vision and anxiety. It is infused with 12% alcohol. Many Sabines swear by its ability to cure everything, and it is something actively being experimented on at the Cheyenne Medical Complex. 

Sabine folk medicine was traditionally performed by traiteurs and traiteuses. These were folk doctors who passed their skills down to members of the opposite sex. Emily’s father, for instance, was a notable traiteur whose expertise proved vital to the exodus. These doctors use a mix of herbal remedies, prayer, and the laying of the hands to heal minor ailments. Don’t let their folksy mannerisms fool you. These are rugged survivalists, skilled in wasteland surgery, amputations and intuiting diagnoses.

  
  
  

==Factional Relations:== 

-Caesar’s Legion: The Sabines’ persecution by Caesar’s Legion, and the failed raid to rescue slaves taken by the Legion, has made the Legion an eternal enemy of the Sabines. The Sabines refuse to render anything to Caesar, and their hatred of them has led to them allying with Free Cheyenne.

-Free Cheyenne: Free Cheyenne is an official alliance with the Sabines. Free Cheyenne provides shelter, food, water, guns and ammunition to the Sabines. In exchange, the Sabines bolster the Free Cheyenne military. However, relations between the two are somewhat rocky. Many Cheyennites view the Sabines as savages and actively discriminate against them. The Sabines resent the Cheyennite council for effectively forcing them into the failed raid against the Legion. However, tensions between the two are effectively put on hold until the Legion is dealt with.



==Possible Outcomes for the Sabines:== 

Generally, the Sabines must choose what their relationship with Free Cheyenne is going to be. Their options are 1) Continue the alliance with Free Cheyenne and assimilate, 2) Continue the alliance with Free Cheyenne and leave after the Battle of the Corridor, and 3) Break the alliance and the Sabines leave now.

  
  

Free Cheyenne Endings: 

-If the alliance is maintained, the Sabines fully integrate with Free Cheyenne. Although Sabine culture and cuisine becomes commonplace and both parties flourish, they have given up their independence, and the Sabine tongue will eventually die out.

-If the alliance is maintained only until the Battle of the Corridor, the Sabines will splinter. Many of the Sabines settle down for prosperity but face discrimination due to their continued independence. Some of the Sabines are unable to cope with this and leave Free Cheyenne, ultimately dying out in the wasteland.

-If the alliance is broken, the Sabines will ultimately travel north, back to Acadia, founding a new republic.

  

Sons of Columbia Endings: 

-If the alliance is maintained, the Sabines will be broken as a group, their culture annihilated by the Sons of Columbia. However, some will become enamored with the group’s strong sense of individualism and desire to create something new.

-If the alliance is maintained only until the Battle of the Corridor, the Sabines break ranks to join the Sons of Columbia and take part in the revolution against the Free Cheyenne council. However, afterwards, they are viewed as unreliable and are forced to leave.

-If the alliance is broken and the Sabines leave, they ultimately settle in the mountains of Idaho.

  

Caesar’s Legion Endings: 

-If the alliance is maintained, the Sabines are exterminated.

-If the alliance is maintained only until the Battle of the Corridor, some of the Sabines manage to flee east. Other Sabines are forced into slavery and to join the ranks of the Legion.

-If the alliance is broken, the Sabines as a whole manage to flee to Montana and begin again.
