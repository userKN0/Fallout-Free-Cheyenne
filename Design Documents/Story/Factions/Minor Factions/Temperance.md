A farming community made up of NCR emigrants who lost their land after the brahmin barons expanded their herds. With this agricultural experience and readily available water, Temperance is considered the breadbasket of the Corridor. The town is run by teetotalers, and does not allow any chems, alcohol, or stimpaks.
