Cannibal tribe that lives at the end of the Cauldron south of Fort Morgan. 

OVERVIEW

When the Great War occurred, it devastated the natural environment as well as the human one. The death of thousands of trees planted for dryland farming purposes and a great drought caused by the disruption of local ecosystems opened up the Great Plains to horrific windstorms.  The windstorms eventually became self-sustaining. The windstorms killed all life within them, allowing them to get bigger and bigger. These windstorms ravaged much of the Great Plains and would become known as “The Cauldron”. To the West, the Cauldron is the point where the world ends. Beyond it, the world is mysterious and unknown, occasionally with small groups, tribes, soldiers and monsters punching through. The East is a land of mystery and danger.

Windstorms that blew in from the Cauldron devastated the already dwindling farmland of southern Wyoming and northern Colorado. The destruction of all plant life in that region led to huge amounts of starvation in the years after the Great War. Even turning to raiding did not yield enough harvest for the population along the Cauldron to survive. Some attempted to pass through to the East, with none returning. Others fled north to the comparative safety of Free Cheyenne. But others took part in one of the oldest taboos: cannibalism.

Over time, cannibalism became a way of life for the raiders living along the Cauldron. These raiders had no value for taking slaves for labor, and instead took prisoners to be eaten. The most esteemed of these raiding groups became known as the “Manhunters”. 

They developed a code of only taking the men and leaving the women and children alone. Caravans that they encountered were given a stark choice: surrender all of their food, or surrender their men. Caravans typically chose the former option. Those who refused both had everything taken from them and given to the pastoralist tribes that had come to live in Greeley. This code means that they are comparatively the least violent and brutal of the major raider gangs operating in the Corridor Wasteland, although the victims they take face certain death.

The Manhunters were small but skilled, operating along a very large stretch of land along the Colorado State Highway 71, Colorado State Highway 36 and the I-70. Caravans passing through learned to have sacrificial slaves and a food surplus to give to them in exchange for leaving them alone.
