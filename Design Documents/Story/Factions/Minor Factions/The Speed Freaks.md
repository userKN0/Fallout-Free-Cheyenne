Raiders who worship the power and speed of Old World machines. Their highest goal is to be like machines, never tiring and perform actions in absolute precision. Colloquially they are known as "the Freaks".

OVERVIEW

Before the Great War, the Choppers were a prominent motorcycle gang that took part in a large criminal underworld driven by Resource Wars rationing. When the bombs fell, they proved to be among the most mobile raiders in Colorado, effectively acting as the Corridor Wasteland’s equivalent of the 80s. For decades, they raided along I-76 and I-25. They proved an early threat to Free Cheyenne’s stability, but a lack of arable land to grow the maize needed to continue powering their motorcycles, they eventually withdrew to the Colorado National Speedway, stockpiling large quantities of still-working machinery.

They continued to maintain their motorcycles in peak condition, partially as a source of pride and partially as a way to return those days of raiding provided they could get the fuel. Over time, the reasons became lost to them, and they began to worship their still pristine vehicles as a time in which they were the raiders in the Corridor Wasteland. The technical knowledge to maintain these vehicles was beaten into their descendants, leading them to slowly idolize speed, precision and accuracy. This cultish devotion to machinery led many in the Wasteland to refer to them as the “Speed Freaks”.

The Speed Freaks charge into battle, screaming and making revving sounds as loudly as possible, partially as an intimidation tactic, partially because they believe that it makes them more like machines and thus better in battle.
