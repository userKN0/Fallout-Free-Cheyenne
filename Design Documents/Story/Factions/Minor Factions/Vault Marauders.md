Vault dwellers that became a raider gang originating from Vault 40 in Estes Park. Their leader is a ZAX AI that was implemented to test the absolute limits of it's crisis management capabilities. Amongst themselves, they are the "Vault Procurement Corps".


**Society:

Prior to the Vault 40’s opening, the internal population was divided into a large main body of dwellers living in a strange form of misery. Its ZAX overseer had concluded early on that the ideal way of governing the original violent population while keeping the maximum number of people alive was to turn the Vault into a pseudo-slum. People are kept on the razor’s edge of starvation and destitution just miserable enough to prevent widespread outbreaks of diseases and social discontent, and they are deliberately kept ignorant only given education on what ZAX and administrative staff deem necessary. Huddled together in too small a space, traditional concepts of family have been erased as ZAX encourages wild population growth balanced on resource conservation to keep a large population and diverse gene pool.

  

A minority of Dwellers descendants from the original Vault-Tec staff live in conditions more akin to a regular Vault, kept mostly separate from the bulk of the populous and filling important roles in security, administration, engineering, medicine etc.. Sometimes, promising members of the bulk population are chosen to be educated and raised into the administrative force.  
  
Upon the realization of the necessity to open the Vault in order to continue its mission despite not having been given an “All Clear” signal, ZAX began to plan on how to go about interacting with the surface. To this end, the Vault Procurement Corps was founded out of members of Vault Security as well as its most violent and abrasive members of the main population. The corps was educated in weapons handling and survival, the ZAX reasoning that such traits would be beneficial in dealing with potential threats on the surface. While technically under the survey of the Vault Administration, in their surface ventures, they are free of accountability except for fulfilling the Overseer’s orders.

  

Upon opening the Vault, the Procurement Corps established a staging ground in the ruins of Estes Park to begin gathering whatever was needed to keep the Vault’s status quo operations going. The local population of nomadic pastoralists was partially enslaved and turned into a topside servile underclass in the rapidly developing Vault Colony.

  

The Overseer’s directive was only to keep the original Vault population and descendants alive so it sees no value in human life not related to its chosen population. The topside colony runs on a caste system of three castes:  
-The top caste is administration, which reports directly to the Overseer. The Vault Procurement Corps is given essentially free reign outside the vault and treated roughly equally to administration inside the vault.

-The middle caste are the Serviles, slaves gathered from tribals and unlucky victims who are used for all manner of menial labor and as expendable fodder to insure the survival of the chosen.

-The lowest caste are the Bastards, the unfortunate offspring of both former casts who due to their relation to Procurement Corps members are considered chosen by ZAX, somewhat in a limbo among the actual population of the colony ZAX sees them as a happy accident and healthy members may be taken back to the Vault to prevent stagnation of the population’s gene pool after two centuries of close relations have whittled down viability.

  
  

**Religion & Spirituality:

There is no real common religion among the population, though some Vault Dwellers see the Overseer as something akin to a god and among the colonial underclass a variety of wasteland faiths are practiced.

  
  

**Politics:

The Marauders are quite isolated from the rest of the local Wasteland, protected by the rough terrain of the Rocky Mountains and with little interest in trade or diplomatic ties. They mainly interact with their neighbors through raids. In rare instances such as being unable to find replacement parts or rare material, ZAX will act through an envoy to negotiate for it. Individual members of the Procurement Corps and the Colony underclass sometimes build ties to traders and smugglers brave enough to engage with them.

  
  

**Technology:

Internally, Vault 40 is technologically akin to other Vaults. Though well past its expiration date, it has been well-maintained and resources have been sparingly managed. The colony in Estes Park is comparable to an American frontier mining town or mountain village crossed with a civil war era native reservation for the slave population.

  
  

**Military:

The Vault Procurement Corps have access to a well-stocked Vault armory (little lethal material was ever used inside the Vault due to the focus on keeping the population alive) and receive tactical advice and planning from ZAX. On raids, they are supported by a disposable supplement of meager slaves who are meant to take a bullet for the chosen population as well as act as mules for the spoils or to be used in dangerous environments.  
  

Still under the Directive of preserving the chosen population, they mainly engage in guerrilla warfare and intentionally preying on weak targets. To this end, former tribal slaves are also employed as trainers and active scouts and trackers to plan out future raids. Should an operation inflict considerable casualties on the Dwellers, ZAX will designate the location or method as dangerous for the future and shun it.

  
  
  
  

**Economy:

With few and rare trade deals and a focus mainly on raiding for resources destined for extraction by the Vault itself, the economy is largely stagnant. What little domestic production the colony in Estes Park possesses is mainly focused on maintenance, meager self sustainable or inhabitants pet projects.

  

The Vault’s internal economy functions like any other Vault only administered by the Overseer along the lines of its “ideal” governance, a planned economy with designated occupations, ration coupons, etc., running on the influx of material from the outside.

**People of note:

The Overseer: A Vault-Tec model 1.2b[2] ZAX supercomputer and designated Overseer of Vault 40. As part of the Vault’s social experiment, it was given the single directive to govern and keep the maximum number of people out of the Vault's original population of violent criminals alive in any given situation, free of moral and ethical constraints. To this end, it rules over the population with a cruel benevolence, utilizing Vault Security to shape a harsh authoritarian society built on the highest possible efficiency at the lowest material cost. After the opening of the Vault, it promoted violent tendencies and adverse personalities among the members of the Procurement Corps, rationing that these traits were beneficial to the population's survival in the Wasteland. On first contact with wasteland residents, it resolved to enslave them as they were not part of or descended from the original Vault 40 population. Therefore, they were not considered under its directive of protection and would form the basis of an underclass of expendable slaves to serve it and the dwellers.

  

**Geography & Locations of note:

The Vault Marauders control quite a large amount of territory comparative to their size, centered in Estes Park the terrain and isolation of the Rockies makes holding onto such vast swaths quite easy even though that control is only nominal further to the edges and they have had a hard time holding onto land inside the Corridor Wasteland proper.

  

**Factional Relations:**

Pretty much no real relations with most factions apart from the Moonrunners and few individual traders.

  

**Terms, Names & Synonyms:**

Vault Marauders / Vault Procurement Corps: The official internal name of the Vaults wasteland operations and colonial administration force is The Vault Procurement Corps, the surrounding population however due to having little actual interaction with them apart from being raided and brutalized simply refer to anyone associated with Vault 40 as Vault Marauders.
