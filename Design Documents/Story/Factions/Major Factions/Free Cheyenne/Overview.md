The city-state of Free Cheyenne was founded nearly 200 years prior to the events of New Vegas. The Road Warriors, a band of US army soldiers having just returned from Canada, staged a mutiny and fled to the Wind River mountains just before the bombs fell. Six years later, they re-emerged and took control of what was left of Cheyenne, declaring it a Free City and planned a campaign towards Washington D.C. to re-establish the American Republic. However their leader, William Cody, died a few years later. His compatriots never followed through on his plans and instead turned Free Cheyenne into it's own city-state they could govern. Some Road Warriors became ghouls and control the city to the present day, colloquially known as the Old Guard.
