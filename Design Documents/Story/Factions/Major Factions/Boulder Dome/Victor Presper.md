Presper is a foil to the player in the game. Whatever faction they align with, whatever choice the player makes in their quests, Presper will criticize and question their choices. The purpose of this is to try and make the player doubt their actions, and attempt to drive them into siding with Presper's aim of ending all human conflict through the threat of annihilation.  

Presper has the design of an grand experiment to test his hypothesis that he can make the Player give up on war. These tests are subplots to the main quest lines in the game. 

Test #1: The Doomed Village - The Player is asked to help a village under attack from raiders. Presper will warn the Player, regardless of the choice made, that this settlement is doomed to perish due to the circumstances of the wasteland. If the Player decides to not help, Presper will also criticize the Player for not taking the opportunity to gain experience from the world.

Test #2: The Unkillable Enemy - An enemy that can't be defeated with any of the Player's weapons or skills. The enemy has to be defeated by it's own failings (mortality, decay, etc) or incomprehensible power (console commands). 

Test #3: (The Non-Fetch Quest) - The Player is tasked to recover an item they can't possible take. They can't convince the quest giver it's impossible, the only way to succeed is to manipulate circumstances where the item isn't necessary. 

Test #4: The Indefensible Ally - The Player has to protect someone who can't possibly be defended, physically or morally. The question of this test is how the Player will use the death of this character. 

Test #5: The Betrayal - Presper betrays the Player and their faction to bring about his world order where war is impossible. The Player has to make a choice whether to help Presper subdue the last remaining faction leader or go after Presper. If the Player sides with Presper peace finally comes to the wasteland, but the story ends. If the Player chooses to go after Presper, the story continues but the cost is enormous.
