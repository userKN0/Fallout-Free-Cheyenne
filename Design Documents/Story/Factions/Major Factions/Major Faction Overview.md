The factions that drive the story. The player will choose between these groups as to who emerges victorious from the conflict.

All four major factions are driven by their experiences of war. Each should exhibit a different trauma that determines their actions and reactions to events that occur. The conclusion the player reach by the end of the game how we should deal with the scars of the past.

Free Cheyenne leadership was influenced by their experiences in the Sino-American War, specifically in quelling insurrections in Canada. The average Cheyennite is influenced by their experience from the River Wars and the War On Raiders. Their reaction is to live in comfort and prosperity as much as possible. 

The Legion is influenced by their experience of conquering Denver, and their own experience of being conquered by the Legion. Their reaction is to relish in conflict and pain as a means of becoming stronger. 

The Sons of Columbia all experience trauma in different varieties depending on their backgrounds: freed slaves from the humiliation suffered by their captors, former raiders from their nihilistic killing and butchery, and Enclave descendants from watching the defeat and destruction of their America. The Chief drives all of these people on a warpath due to his trauma experienced during the collapse of the Midwestern Brotherhood. Their reaction is to erase all history, and with it, erase all memory of their trauma.

Victor Presper experienced his trauma from traveling the American wasteland from California to Colorado and seeing tribes fight to the death over dirt and ash. His reactions is to bring an end to war itself.
