The Sons of Columbia are a faction that seeks to destroy the remains of the Old World, and topple the factions that lay claim to it. 

If Caesar's Legion is a critique of the archetypical tyrant, then the Sons of Columbia should be a critique of the archetypical revolutionary.   



The Sons of Columbia are one of the four main factions for Fallout: Free Cheyenne. Opposed to both Free Cheyenne and Caesar’s Legion, they ultimately seek to annihilate all traces of the Old World from before the bombs in order to build a new society.

**Game Lore:

  

The Sons of Columbia began as a modest group of followers who began to listen to the words of the Chief, a mysterious wasteland wanderer who claimed he had the answers to a better life. The Chief claimed that their misery and destitution was because of the Old World and those who attempt to revive it. 

  

With refugees from the Legion invasion pouring into Free Cheyenne, the Chief and his followers went to aid the relief mission. The refugees, known as Freenians, who were driven from their homes by the Legion and resented by the Cheyennites became receptive to what the Chief and his followers said. Eventually things went awry when one of the Cheyennites attempted to assassinate the Chief for “communist subversion”. The Chief and his followers were banished from Free Cheyenne and sought refuge in the nearby settlement of Fort Columbia.
