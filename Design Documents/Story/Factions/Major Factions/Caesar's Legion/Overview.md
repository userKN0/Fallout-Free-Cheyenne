Caesar's Legion took control of Denver in 2279 at a very steep cost, breaking the unending tide of conquest in Colorado. Ferrarius, the Iron Legate, was put in command of the city with a token garrison. The wild dogs that plagued Denver for decades have been all but exterminated by the Legion. The remaining mongrels have been walled off to the inner city. With Denver free of tribals and vicious animals, the ruined city is experiencing a land rush by free Legion subjects in search of fresh water, land, and opportunities. The Legion is now caught between it's military mission and the economic interests that have moved into the city.
