OVERVIEW

Reclusive tribals with an affinity for Pre-War technology, descendant from scientists who attempted to preserve the knowledge of the mathematics and computer science.  Suffering from crop failure and facing famine, the Ciphers were contacted by Victor Presper from the Boulder Dome through their machines and promised them a G.E.C.K. if they could find and bring him the key to re-open the Dome. Using satellite access provided by Presper to triangulate the location, the Ciphers' toughest and most clever member, Eloi, organized a raid to the Mojave to steal the key from the East Forty Caravan Company.


**CIPHERS DESIGN DOCUMENT

**Timeline:

2077

SEP 2077 - The President of the United States signs Executive Order 99066, allowing the mass internment of Chinese-American civilians. The Think Tank is given authorization to use any of these interned for human experimentation. This triggers a wave of protests from many of the technicians at the facility. 

  

OCT 20, 2077 - A number of technicians break out of the Big Mountain Research and Development Complex. They bring with them scores of records involving human experimentation, unethical experiments and abuses of power; and a mobile terminal that controls linkup with one of Big MT’s satellites. They publicize the horrors that went on in Big MT. The U.S. government is unable to respond due to the collapse of order throughout the entire country.

  

OCT 23, 2077 - The defecting technicians at the Big Mountain Research and Development Complex make camp in Death Valley. The walls of the valley protect most of them from radioactive fallout. Fully aware that if the knowledge they gathered at Big MT is lost, then the post-war civilizations might one day repeat the same mistakes. They develop an almost religious devotion to preventing the loss of knowledge from coming to pass, even as many of the technicians die from poor survival skills.

  

DEC 2077 - A roving band of military deserters, led by Cpt. Henry Rodriguez, from the Hopeville Military Base enter the Death Valley. They encounter the surviving technicians from Big MT. Rodriguez takes pity on them. Rodriguez, who had heard both their broadcast and Roger Maxson’s broadcast, is convinced that their knowledge needs to survive in the post-war world. Rodriguez begins teaching the technicians rudimentary survival skills, allowing them to prosper in the valley.

  
  

2080 - Now that the Big MT technicians are largely self-sufficient, Cpt. Henry Rodriguez announces that he will be leading an expedition to the great pre-war centers of science across the west. His goal is to make sure that the knowledge is properly stored at the places most likely to understand it. The technicians record their information on four of their six terminals. The information is recorded redundantly. Huge amounts of technical data are recorded, and Rodriguez leads his troops east. This event is recorded in Cipher history as “The Division”.

  

2085 - The technicians in Death Valley suffer a calamity. The sole computer that houses the information about Big MT and Mariposa breaks down. The technicians are unable to maintain the satellite linkup terminal that allows them to maintain contact with Rodriguez and the technical information on the same drive. One of the technicians, possessing an eidetic memory, rewrites all of the information on the terminal by hand and teaches the technicians, the deserters and their children all of the knowledge he possesses. Most of the children are dyslexic, so he instead focuses on rote memorization. He is remembered in Cipher history as “Nemonik”.

  

2086 - Nemonik dies before he can teach his students how to write. Most of the deserters in Death Valley remember the application of his technical information, but not the scientific theory behind it. In addition, his warnings of the places of great evil become corrupted over time. Big MT is remembered as both the “Big Empty” and “Farm of Souls”. While Mariposa is remembered as Mariposa, FEV becomes the “Fev blight”. 

  

2088 - Cpt. Rodriguez sends his last report to Death Valley. He states that all attempts to find suitable locations for storing the knowledge have failed. He states that Bloomfield, Los Alamos and Big Mountain were all impossible to enter. He states although the Navajo agreed to try and store some of the knowledge, they could make no guarantees due to the worsening situation outside the reservation borders. He does state that he has found information at a Greenway terminal about a place called “The Nursery”, itself connected to a “Boulder Dome”. He states that information there indicates if an entire city could have survived there, then he could persuade the people to avoid making the mistakes of the Old World when they begin again.

-Shortly after this, the satellite uplink terminal suffers a power surge and breaks. The technicians are unable to repair it without spare parts, but do manage to make it dormant. Cipher history records that the Boulder Dome is “The Zero”, where society can begin again from nothing. When Rodriguez’s troops divided into the zero, they were erased from this earth.

  

2089 - Cpt. Rodriguez’s expedition reaches Colorado. His troops winter in the Mesa Verde National Park, with the goal of gathering new supplies for the march to the north. Some of his troops behind, with the goal of keeping the knowledge in a non-scientific location in the event that Boulder Dome is also uninhabitable. It is also meant to be a supply base that they can pass through on their return journey from Boulder Dome. 

-After the failure of Cpt. Rodriguez’s expedition, the unit that stayed behind in Mesa Verde, continues to live a more naturalistic lifestyle. Many of them can read and write, so they work to continue recording knowledge of Big MT, Mariposa and Boulder Dome. Over time, they become the base for a new tribe, the Flat Tops, derived from the meaning of “Mesa” and the buzz cuts their troops wear..

  

2090 - Cpt. Rodriguez’s troops manage to find the location of Boulder Dome, but are killed when they pass too close to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. Several of the terminals regarding the knowledge are picked up by Free Cheyenne marshals searching for military equipment to help defend the city better.

  

2158 - The Guardians of the Old Order, badly depleted by their war with The Reservation, decide to establish a base in Mesa Verde National Park. This brings them into contact with the Flat Tops. The Flat Tops do not possess advanced technology, and so, the Guardians are allowed to make camp in their territory.

  

2165 - The peace between the Flat Tops and the Guardians of the Old Order breaks down. The Guardians demand that the Flat Tops surrender the single terminal that the Flat Tops worship as a holy artifact. The Guardians are forced from Mesa Verde after a guerrilla war. The Guardians leave Mesa Verde in search of a new place to secure technology.

  

2168 - The Followers of the Apocalypse send an expedition to determine if the Hoover Dam is still functional. Along the way to the Old Mormon Fort, they encounter the technicians in Death Valley. By now, the technicians have tribalized. Their language, full of numbers and mathematical concepts, is almost incomprehensible to the Followers. When some of the Followers begin work on translation, they realize that the tribe’s obsession with numbers indicates a very advanced understanding of mathematics and that the tribe must be speaking in code. This leads to the technicians being given the name “Ciphers”.

  

2173 - The Flat Tops make contact with The Reservation. They establish relations on the basis of mutual defense against the Guardians of the Old Order. Several Super Mutants are fascinated at the Flat Tops’ legends of the Fev blight, Mariposa and the Big Empty. Within a year, the Flat Tops join the anti-Guardians alliance with The Reservation and the Rocketmen.

  

2175 - The Followers of the Apocalypse successfully crack the Ciphers’ language and realize that their language and history have revealed a rich library of pre-war knowledge, scientific locations and technical knowledge. The Followers successfully persuade a group of the Ciphers to come to the west to form the Abbey of Lost Knowledge. Most of the Ciphers stay behind in Death Valley, living their naturalistic and rural life.

  

2276 - The Colorado Campaign begins in force. Initially begun by the Legion as a way to deprive The Reservation of a key ally, the Flat Tops, it eventually balloons into the conquest of Denver. Lanius annihilates the Flat Tops and destroys much of their new settlements in Mesa Verde. A handful of their members are taken as slaves.

  

2277 - There is a famine in Death Valley. Coincidentally, Father Elijah, looking for information on Big Mountain, arrives in the area. Within days, he fixes their terminals, restoring both the satellite uplink terminal and uncorrupting their hard drive full of information. Elijah leaves for Big Mountain. After a month or so, The Divide erupts into nuclear hellfire, making large parts of the Death Valley uninhabitable. 

  

2278 - The Ciphers search the archives that Elijah opened for them and discover that Boulder Dome, the mythical Zero, is real. The Cipher tribal leader sends Eloi east to recover technology capable of revitalizing their community.

  

2279 - Eloi arrives outside Boulder Dome. Victor Presper is able to make contact with him, promising him a GECK, advanced technical knowledge and understanding of the many mysteries of the Ciphers’ words; in exchange for help in obtaining one of the keys to open Boulder Dome.

  

2280 - Eloi returns to Death Valley. He gathers a force of warriors to help him carry Victor Presper’s plan to capture a key to Boulder Dome from the East Forty Company.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

**Culture

The Ciphers have a long and varied history due to the many migrations they have engaged in over the past two centuries. The Cipher community at the Abbey of Lost Knowledge is as distinct as the Cipher community in Mesa Verde is as distinct as the Cipher community in Death Valley. However, all tribes of the Cipher diaspora share a common background that emphasizes memorization and knowledge of mathematics that has become legend over time. The Ciphers’ belief in mathematics imbues their everyday language. Their language is very convoluted, obtuse and stilted, leading many to believe that they are speaking in code.

“Integration.” - Surveying or scouting an area; or making something bigger.

“Derive it.” - Make it smaller.

“Evaluate the equation.” - Solve the problem.

“Change your x and y value.” - Move left and right, or back and forth.

“He has been classically analyzed.” - He is dead.

“A ring unites the field.” - There’s a pattern here.

  

“Bear people.” - NCR

“Bull people.” - Legion

“Metal people.” - Brotherhood of Steel

“Metal demons.” - Enclave

“The green giants.” - Super Mutants

“The screaming ones.” - Nightkin

  
  

**Creation Myth:

The Ciphers believe that the world was created by The Zero, a being/concept/place from which all things begin, grow and end. The world initially consisted of simple numbers that lived peacefully with outside interference. As time went on, the numbers learned how to interact with each other, creating new additions, subtractions, multiplications. The numbers grew in complexity and took on human shape, but this proved too difficult for the numbers to communicate with each other.

  

They vowed to return to The Zero, the time in which times were simpler. Their attempts to divide themselves and return to The Zero were marked by terrible experiments. The fev blight, the Farm of Souls, and years of war and violence culminated in the birth of a monstrous creature: the E-Roar. The E-Roar rampaged through the world, annihilating all in its path. The numbers summoned their best warriors and magicians - Alges, Trigo, Geom and Calcu. The magicians bound the E-Roar in a matrix deep below the earth. 

  

The E-Roar tainted the earth, tearing the strings that bound the world together apart. The strings changed randomly and chaotically, settling into new forms, hiding away The Zero until the world could begin again. The world was tainted with E-Roar’s children. The radscorpion, the deathclaw, the ghoul, the mutant, all born from E-Roar toying with the multiplications of their birth.

  

The magicians resolved to hide away the knowledge that had tempted the numbers to return to The Zero, creating E-Roar. They destroyed enormous amounts of knowledge but allowed their chosen discipline, Nemonik, to teach his people the knowledge to prevent the E-Roar from returning. Nemonik is the great hero of the Ciphers.

  

Nemonik set some of his chosen disciplines to other lands to teach the knowledge. His disciples spread across the wasteland but failed to find places capable of accepting the knowledge until they found The Zero on Earth. They presented the knowledge that Nemonik had entrusted them with, but to their horror, they discovered that equations read one way could be read the other. The E-Roar was on the verge of return, but the brave disciples made the ultimate sacrifice. They divided into The Zero, ready to be born again. The Zero chose to kill the E-Roar and hid them away so that when the world began again, their sacrifice would be remembered.

  
  

**The Ciphers in Death Valley:

The Ciphers in Death Valley are the original and largest group of Ciphers. They are a mix of pre-war technicians and soldiers. The technicians are remembered in Cipher as the “Tesh”, and the soldiers are remembered as the “Desert People” (deserters). The Tesh were skilled in the preservation of knowledge, while the Desert People were skilled in traversing and surviving in the desert.

  

The Ciphers have encountered many people traversing through Death Valley over the years, including the Brotherhood of Steel, the NCR, the nascent community of Hopeville, the Rangers and the Followers of the Apocalypse. The NCR and the Rangers used the area as one of the ways to transport supplies from New California to Nevada, and it was used as a vital route for supplies from the NCR to the Arizona Rangers during the Great Raider War.

  

Still, no one has claimed control of Death Valley. It is a very inhospitable place, racked by very prolonged periods of heat and periodic dust storms from The Divide. Most of the Ciphers lived in low-hanging adobe buildings with very large basements. The Ciphers have large underground hydroponics farms protected from the harsh desert sun, and a large water silo that contains water irregularly brought in from the Amargosa River.

  

The destruction of The Divide caused earthquakes throughout the entire region, and the dust storms that were once regular but infrequent become irregular and very frequent. The underground hydroponics chamber collapsed, and most of the underground water silos burst. Hundreds of adobe homes collapsed. Radioactive smoke flooded the valley, choking the air and poisoning the ground. Half of the tribe was killed in the days after The Divide erupted. 

  

The tribe elder, Denom, has sent the tribe’s most cunning warrior, Eloi, to figure out what secrets can be gathered from The Zero (Boulder Dome) to rejuvenate the tribe.

  
  

The Ciphers in the Abbey:

The Ciphers in the Abbey of Lost Knowledge are heavily influenced by the beliefs of the Followers of the Apocalypse. Brought to the abbey so that the Followers could transcribe huge amounts of their knowledge into a usable form for most of the wasteland. The Ciphers guard the knowledge so that it is preserved, even though most of them can’t actually read the knowledge they are protecting.

  

The Abbey of Lost Knowledge is an old-world cathedral upgraded to be a fallout shelter by a small sect of good samaritans. It is located in Nevada, north of Vault City. The abbey is an outpost of the Followers of the Apocalypse, although most of the day-to-day work of maintenance is carried out by the Ciphers. Visitors are free to read and copy anything they want, but they are not allowed to take any of the books from the abbey.

  

Some of these Ciphers are used by the Followers to help with complicated equations. The Ciphers use a system of spoken calculations, falsely believing that the mathematical equations involved were so powerful that they could alter reality and therefore the computers housing them. 

  
  

**The Ciphers in Mesa Verde:

Captain Rodriguez’s military expedition to find a place suitable for storing knowledge about the old world encountered problems at Big Mountain, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Bloomfield Space Center. After visiting the Great Southwest Confederacy, he learned of the existence of The Nursery. Further investigation revealed its links to a place called “Boulder Dome”.

  

The expedition wintered in Mesa Verde National Park. Some of the expedition members stayed behind, with the goal of maintaining contact with the confederacy and possibly figuring out a way inside Los Alamos National Laboratory. Rodriguez died, and the group was left alone. Over time, they became known as the “Flat Tops”, due to their buzz cut hairstyles. 

  

The Flat Tops lived a largely communal lifestyle in Mesa Verde’s many pueblos, emphasizing growth of the Three Sisters (corn, beans and squash), small-scale hunting and sustainable farming. They had to fight off many other tribes and raiders in order to maintain control of the area. 

  

The Flat Tops made contact with several of the new powers emerging in New Mexico, most notably The Reservation. By now, the Flat Tops had forgotten their original purpose, and so simply engaged in minor slave trading with the Res. After the Guardians’ defeat at the hands of The Reservation, the Guardians settled in Mesa Verde.

  

While relations between the two were initially good, the Guardians demanded the sole terminal that the Flat Tops kept as a holy artifact. War broke out, and the Guardians were driven from Mesa Verde. The Flat Tops were approached by the Rocketmen and The Reservation for an alliance against the Guardians. The Flat Tops agreed, and relations flourished. 

  

When Caesar’s Legion entered the area, the Flat Tops agreed to supply the Legion with slaves for use in their war in Phoenix. Peace between the groups was broken when the Legion decided to take out The Reservation, as its policy of irradiating the surrounding area was driving down fertility rates. The war ended in 2276, but the Legion decided to improve its standing in the area and deprive the Res of allies, starting with the Flat Tops.

  

The Flat Tops were annihilated by a new legate known as “Lanius”, with the women and children being taken as slaves. What began a simple expedition to secure Legion supply lines in New Mexico would balloon into the Colorado Campaign and the conquest of Denver.**
