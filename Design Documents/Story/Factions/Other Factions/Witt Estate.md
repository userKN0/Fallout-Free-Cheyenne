Setting:

The Kingdom or the Witt Estate is centered around Castle Witt, the romantic ego project of Pre-War libertarian and casino tycoon Barry Witt. It is located in the former town of Ryan Park, Wyoming, at the western edge of the Medicine Bow National Forest. 

  

What started out as pseudo-libertarian commune evolved into a hereditary wasteland monarchy, now imperialized by a stronger regional power. Most people live a lifestyle comparable to medieval or pre-industrial peasants in isolated hamlets and villages in the plains and on the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The heart of the local conflict is along split lines of the royal family with the traditionalist side seeking greater independence while trying to restore the monarchy and the other wanting further integration with FC hoping to join their oligarchic ruling class.

|2165|After years of diplomatic pressure, Lucky accepts a trade agreement with Free Cheyenne that will heavily disadvantage the Witt Estate. His younger sister, Providence, launches a coup through the Royal Guard in an attempt to overthrow him and renege on the agreement. FC uses this to justify a military intervention and force the royal family to abdicate, though they do remain politically influential.|
|2168|The River Wars end. Free Cheyenne secures control of most of the waterways of the north.|
|2169|The Witt royal family splits. Lucky goes into exile in Free Cheyenne, while Providence stays active and enters Ryan Park politics, serving as a councilwoman instead of a queen.|
|2176|The Free Cheyenne Marshals Service intervenes in the elections for the first time since their takeover of the Witt Estate. The Monarchist Party, led by Providence Witt, which simply advocates the restoration of the monarchy is blocked from taking office on a series of technicalities, and the election is overturned. Similar interventions are required in 2181, 2183, 2187, 2190, 2192 and 2196. Interventions range from running false candidates, splitting the monarchist vote, deregistering Monarchist voters, voter intimidation and outright ballot theft.|

John is committed to the restoration of the monarchy, believing that elections are taxing on the average citizen and are forcing them to vote for inadequate great leaders.<br><br>  <br><br>Lucky Witt dies of cirrhosis, at the age of 59. His daughter, known as ‘Emilia’, becomes the heir to his branch of the Witt royal family. His daughter, heavily influenced by the policies of Free Cheyenne, decides to return to politics in Ryan Park.

However, the nationalization process was expensive as she had to pay heavy bribes to the council’s allies in Ryan Park in order to guarantee that there wouldn’t be any opposition. The subsequent collapse of Ryan Park’s budget sends the town into recession. Unable to sell the Sugarloaf Line back to Free Cheyenne, she is forced to make a deal to sell off Ryan Park’s own trade caravans and to request a bailout from Free Cheyenne. This destroys whatever popularity she had initially gained, and she resigns the leader of the Witte royal family in favor of her nephew, ‘Grayson’.<br><br>-Grayson Witt proves to be a poor political leader of Ryan Park, unable to navigate the complicated business world of Free Cheyenne or the nobility of the domain.

John Witt wins the elections and suspends elections for the indeterminate future.<br><br>  <br><br>The Free Cheyenne Council organizes an internal coup against Grayson Witt, who is already willing to give up leadership of the party. The council selects ‘Howard Witt’, a compromise candidate within the royal family. Howard is from a much older line of the family, descended from one of the sons of Hubert Witt’s wives. Howard acts as the regent for the infant son of Grayson Witt, named ‘Louis’. <br><br>  <br><br>John Witt abdicates as Baron of the Witt Estate in favor of Louis Witt, who has a much better claim to the throne. Howard Witt remains as regent, although he and Witt agree to cycle as regent to Louis every five years. John Witt stays on as an influential advisor, after which Louis Witt will take the throne. The Free Cheyenne Council considers the situation solved, and, as a token of goodwill, agrees to reduce the presence of the Marshals in the city.|
|2218|Louis Witt is killed in a hunting accident in Medicine Bow, aged 12 years old. This effectively breaks the agreement between John Witt and Howard Witt. When John Witt declares his un-abdication, Howard declares himself the rightful monarch. The two branches become completely contrarian to each other, constantly undermining each other. This eventually settles into the routine of the voters of Ryan Park electing a more or less conservative monarch every five years. Free Cheyenne’s attempts to introduce republicanism into Ryan Park consistently fail, and they ultimately give up on trying to remove the monarchy entirely, instead just backing the Free Wyoming Party. The Marshals are reintroduced to the surrounding area, albeit with a drastically reduced presence.|

Society:

The Witt Estate’s royal family has been established over three generations as a fact of life in Ryan Park even if their popularity waxes and wanes over the decades. The acceptance of this society has led most people to subsist under a medieval standard of living, making their living as woodsmen, farmers, hunters and the like. The common folk tend to live in genial cohorts on inherited plots of land under familial patriarchs and matriarchs. Men and women are politically equal, but mutants are in a legal limbo.

  

Castle Witt is the center of political life and power, as well as economic advancement. Promising prospects are given the opportunity to directly serve and study there, being given an education and groomed in political administration. These administrators are sent to allied settlements to help organize, enforce the law and report any new development.

  

Religion & Spirituality:

Barry Witt was a staunch atheist, but tolerated religion as part of his libertarian ideals. As a result, the domain never adopted a state religion. A confluence of beliefs are practiced, ranging from Pre-War confessions of Christianity to a myriad of Post-War cults and beliefs.

  
  

Politics:

The Witt Estate has been under the influence of the Free Cheyenne and the Marshal Service since the 2165 coup attempt and subsequent military intervention. Because most of the population does support the monarchy in some form, the Monarchist Party has become the most powerful political force in Domain politics. The party, founded by Providence Witt and led by her descendants, was instrumental in turning the society into an elected monarchy. 

  

The Monarchist Party is contested by the Free Wyoming Party, led by a separate branch of the royal family sponsored by Free Cheyenne. As a result, citizens regularly vote for and against these factions of the royal family, going to the polls every five years. 

  

Over time, the Monarchist Party has settled into a conservative political party, and the Free Wyoming Party has settled into a more libertarian political party.

  

Technology:

Most of the population lives in conditions akin to medieval peasants with occasional sprinkles of modern comforts. Electricity comes from a mix of old generators, hydroelectric generators along the Sugarloaf Line and whatever else people can get their hands on.

  

Castle Witt itself is a repository of Pre-War comfort and technology, most of it in the hands of the military and the royal family. Computers are used for administration and machinery is used in core industries.

  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Military:

The Witt Estate initially did not have an official fighting force, as the idea ran counter to Barry Witt’s libertarian ideals. Instead, he expected the city and the surrounding towns to form spontaneous militias to deal with threats on the local level. But after repeated confrontations with the Marshal Service, Hubert Witt put together a standing response force. Annalee Witt formalized them as the “Royal Wardens”.

  

Administrators also form their own de facto military force. Mainly composed of woodsmen, survivalists, hunters and trackers, they patrol the Medicine Bow National Forest and enforce the law in isolated communities. They are also required to tend to the forests, as a legacy to the National Park Service. While smaller and worse equipped (some even resorting to bows and slingshots) than the Marshal Service, they know the terrain well and are trained in guerrilla warfare.

  

Economy:

The Witt Estate’s economy is largely stagnant, with neither large amounts of imports nor large amounts of exports. The majority of workers work in lumber, woodworking, masonry, farming and animal husbandry. Trade is mainly focused inward. There is not even a codified currency, though the most commonly used one is the Free Cheyenne silver dollar, although Legion denarii, caps and Indian dollars are also used.

  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

People of Note:

Barry Witt: An eccentric libertarian pre-war casino tycoon who got rich operating a chain of cheap copycat casinos all over the southwestern United States. Witt used the influx of cheap labor brought in by the U.S. occupation of Mexico to operate his businesses at massive gain, quickly rising to prominence. Though he never reached similar levels of wealth and influence as Robert House or John Bradberton, he became a popular Wyoming politician (think a mix of Huey Long and John McAfee) in the late 2050s.

  

Witt’s politics were a hodgepodge of Randian Objectivism, Barry Goldwater-style paleoconservatism and European medieval systems. Accordingly, Witt believed very strongly in individuals supporting their own routes to happiness, protection of the environment and the code of chivalry. For instance, he was instrumental in the outright removal of the minimum wage in Wyoming before the war, but also twisted the arms of church and business leaders to donate to charities as much as humanly possible (analogous to the situation in the Vendée in pre-revolutionary France).

  

He pushed the abolition of restrictions of drugs, pornography, prostitution, polygamy and gambling. Of this, he was really only truly successful on gambling, although his efforts to end polygamy earned him a life-long friends in the form of two Utah Senators who regularly visited his estate in Ryan Park. His largest private endeavor was the purchase of the Medicine Bow National Forest from the U.S. government. Witt, for all of his other faults, was determined to put his money where his mouth was, and was an able steward of the forest and successfully blocked multiple efforts to develop it.

  

Witt’s deep interest in European medieval history and fantasy got him labeled as a crank by tabloids. However, his wealth and influence enabled him to indulge in his tastes. He created a European-style medieval castle with all of the modern comforts near Ryan Park, Wyoming.

  

After the Great War, he leveraged his resources for goodwill in the community and to care for the caravans of refugees roaming the countryside, providing protection from raiders, work and a place to stay, built along a mixture of libertarian free market principles and his romanticized image of a benevolent ruler.

  

He used his newfound power to try and bring about his vision for a libertarian feudalism. He named his old economic advisor his “Lord High Chancellor”, his son his “prince” and his board of directors his “nobles”. Witt himself believes that taking the title of “king” would have been a betrayal of the Founding Fathers, so he himself took the title “Baron”.

  

Witt promoted arranged marriages, and offered social advancement to anyone willing to marry into his family. He gifted his son a veritable harem of spouses and prospective maidens, although Hubert Witt himself seemed largely uninterested in them and far more interested in maintaining good will towards the people in their domain.

  

He also promoted the mass adoption of bows instead of guns and swords instead of knives, arguing that they were weapons of a more civilized age. He also required that towns not have standing militias or standing armies, with the militias only to be raised in times of emergency.  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  

Hubert Witt: Hubert Witt immediately succeeded his father as the leader of his domain. Hubert was more focused on establishing his position as a popular autocrat and consolidating the security of the young political entity’s position. He repealed his father’s ban on a standing army and made serious efforts to protect the people of the domain from fathers with the only request being a tithe. He also appointed his father’s nobles as mayors and high sheriffs, granting them offices and tracts of land to secure his own personal position. His advisor was his old D&D-style grandmaster (given the position of “Sorcerer”) who played games with him while his father was away from home on business. Witt’s grandmaster encouraged him to “do what his character would do”.

  

Witt ‘s promotion of chivalry was regarded not just as a social contract with the townsfolk, but a legal one. He viewed it as a lens to view the way that individuals should act to each other, and as long as the government was minimal, so people could associate however they wished (except in the form of trade unions, as his father had long banned them as supporters of the collectivist ideal).

  

Witt was also fiercely independent, refusing to even consider negotiations with Free Cheyenne on sharing or relinquishing control of the area’s water sources. Witt was mortally wounded during the Marshals’ service in 2122, his last act to name his daughter Amalee as his successor as Queen, thus formally declaring the creation of the kingdom.

  

Annalee Witt: The daughter of Hubert Witt and first “real” monarch of Witt Castle. As the first person to have been raised without the libertarian ideas that her grandfather espoused, she was more interested in shaping the overt monarchical system. She would be regarded as a popular sovereign, ruling for the better part of three decades.

  

Her reign is marked by pragmatism, such as the creation of a unified tax code, administrative and military reform, the formal creation of the Royal Wardens, and formal granting of feudal titles. Nobles were required to pay back to the communities that they resided, and if enough people believed that a noble wasn’t doing his/her job, then she could recall them and strip them of their rank. The nobles decried this system as “chivalry at gunpoint”. This was not entirely altruistic, as she did this, fully knowing that nobles with this system could never become entrenched.

  

Her primary focus for developing the Witt Estate’s expansion was economic self-sufficiency and to keep Free Cheyenne’s focus away from her new kingdom. Accordingly, her policies espoused autarky, with an emphasis on farming, in order to avoid the free market competition with Free Cheyenne as well as to prevent them from becoming dependent on the Free Cheyenne’s traders. She also chose to stabilize the borders through the integration of nomads, raiders and tribals. Perhaps her greatest accomplishment was authorizing the construction of the Sugarloaf Line to make the Witt Estate fully self-sufficient in terms of water from Free Cheyenne. 

  

However, these policies only agitated Free Cheyenne, and unable to use their conventional methods of influence, the council decided to assassinate her in 2153 in favor of her more easily influenced son. However, she remained popular after her death, which cemented the legacy of the royal family.

  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
Lucky Witt: The son and eldest child of Annalee Witt. Politically untalented and easily influenced, he was the preferred choice of the Free Cheyenne City Council, who forced him to accept increasing concessions to Free Cheyenne. He survived the pro-monarchist coup and subsequent military intervention in 2165, but the widening gulf between him and his sister, Providence Witt, would lead to him to move to Free Cheyenne in 2169, splitting the family in two.

  
  

Providence Witt: The daughter and youngest child of Annalee Witt. Her frustration with her brother caving to Free Cheyenne at every opportunity and squandering the Domain’s potential led her to attempt a coup against him in 2165. The coup failed and was used as justification of the Free Cheyenne Marshal Service. The Witt royal family was forced out of government, but retained most of its assets. After the family split in 2169, she went into local politics and formed the Monarchist Party.

  

Geography & Locations of note:

Medicine Bow National Forest: The Medicine Bow National Forest presents a natural obstacle and border between The Witt Estate and Free Cheyenne. Free Cheyenne’s Marshals are forced to circumnavigate it from the north in order to approach the Domain. The forest is also a main driver of the economy, providing lumber, stone, game and other resources for the population. It is under the stewardship of the Royal Wardens.

The Sugarloaf Line: A public works project authorized by Annalee Lee. The line consists of an aqueduct that connects Castle Witt with the water reservoirs of Medicine Bow Peak and Sugarloaf Mountain. It is roughly 14-18 kilometers (8.6-11 miles) in length and has a practical combination of scrap, wood, stone and other easily accessible materials. The Sugarloaf Line has been consistently improved and maintained over the decades.

  

The line was built in order to better open up Medicine Bow National Forest to the Domain economy, as well as to guarantee an independent water supply. The line transports water, lumber and other goods downstream out of the forest as well as to generate electricity.

Castle Witt: A European-style castle fitted with all of the modern luxuries the Pre-War world had to offer. In the Post-War, it provided space, commendations and shelter from the wastes. The Witt clan has maintained and expanded the castle for the past two centuries. The castle is capable of withstanding an actual siege. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Factional Relations:  
Free Cheyenne: Free Cheyenne considers the Domain more of a nuisance in periodic need of being put in place, they mainly exert control via the “Free Wyoming Party” occasionally over the years attempts had been made to economically cripple / disadvantage the Kingdom, one such incident was a failed attempt to blow up part of the Sugarloaf-Line during a diplomatic mission in 2248 which included a young King Messer and Cutter, the latter as a legal liaison. Unbeknownst to both of them, members of the mission were planning a terrorist attack on behalf of the FC City Council. Messer accidentally discovered and foiled the plot earning him renown and reputation in the Domain with Cutter clearing up the legal situation.

Hecate: Since the Daughters’ rise to power in Utah and Colorado, they have increasingly begun raiding isolated tribes and communities in southern Wyoming, trying to force them to provide tributes for their biological and chemical weapons projects. The Marshal Service, too static and busy with the Legion encroachment in the Corridor is ineffective against their tactics, leaving the denizens of the Kingdom to fend for themselves against increasing raids, trying to abduct children and steal resources.
