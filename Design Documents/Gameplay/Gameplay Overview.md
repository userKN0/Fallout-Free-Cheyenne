Gameplay should be similar to Fallout: New Vegas with on role-playing, dialogue, exploration, combat, etc, but also taken another step further. 

Every quest should be possible to complete through four different methods: combat, dialogue, stealth, and science. 

50% of all gameplay in FNV is engaging in dialogue with NPCs. In order to make this gameplay engaging for players, all dialogue needs to have a clear purpose whether it's to influence an NPC, ask for information, or to communicate information for an NPC to react to. 

Speech should not be click-to-win, but dialogue trees should also not be complicated with different skills just for the sake of making a certain outcome difficult. Speech should be an option to open up dialogue options to influence an NPC, and the Player should engage and determine from these options which would best influence the NPC based on the circumstances and character. 

Barter should also be used in dialogue more to negotiate or make deals. 

Use Speech checks in dialogue to convince or trick an NPC, use Barter checks to negotiate or persuade.
