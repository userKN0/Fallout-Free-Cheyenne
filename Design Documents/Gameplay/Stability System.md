Factions in Free Cheyenne will have a stability system on a scale of 0 to 20 that affects random encounters, merchants, and dialogue in their territory. As the Player completes quests in the main story or faction aligned side quests, the stability of that faction will either increase or decrease based on actions taken. 

Faction stability can also affected by random events that occur due to the fault-line system, making the world feel alive and not 100% within the complete whim and control of the Player. 

The stability system will work where story events that occur will affect a "permanent stability" and random events will work within a "stability range" so that the overall stability cannot crater if the Player maxes out a faction's stability storywise, and vise versa.
