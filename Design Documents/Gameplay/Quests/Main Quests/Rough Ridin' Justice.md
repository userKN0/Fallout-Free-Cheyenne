OVERVIEW
With the recovery expedition having arrived in the Corridor, the team needs to find the Ciphers who stole the artifact. The Visitor's first stop will be the town of Laramie, before moving on to many other settlements in the Corridor in search of the bandits. 

STAGES

5 - (Optional) Discuss with your team about the bandits.

10 - Talk to Laramie's sheriff about where the Ciphers went.

20 - Head to Free Cheyenne and ask the Chief Deputy Marshal about the location of the Ciphers.

30 - Travel to the Cipher camp at Fort Morgan.

40 - Get information about the massacre from any survivors.

50 - Go to Denver and speak with the Legion commander about Eloi.

BREAKDOWN
-In the Laramie Sheriff's office, a report will give the player the information to progress the quest to Free Cheyenne.
-At the Marshal Service HQ in Free Cheyenne, there is a message on the Chief Deputy's terminal that will allow the player to progress the quest to Fort Morgan.
-At Fort Morgan, the player comes across the aftermath of the battle between the Sons of Columbia and Theo the Supermutant. In the gas station they can find Eve, a Cipher scout, who was presumed dead and left behind by Eloi. She has a map of the Corridor that charts where Eloi is headed next. 
-In Denver the player can find Cameron, the FotA companion of Eloi, crucified. Freeing Cameron is optional, but allows for the best ending for the Ciphers. Gaining an audience with Ferrarius, the Legate will tell the player that Eloi has gone to Boulder. If the player wants Cameron freed, he'll need to do a favor in exchange. 
-At Boulder, the player will find Eloi has succumb to wounds he suffered at Denver. His body is being guarded by the pariah dog, Murphy. If players want to avoid combat, they can use stat checks or the Animal Friend perk to convince Murphy to leave Eloi and reunite with Eve.
-The player can take the Boulder Dome key from Eloi's body and enter the Dome, completing the quest and the first act of the story.
