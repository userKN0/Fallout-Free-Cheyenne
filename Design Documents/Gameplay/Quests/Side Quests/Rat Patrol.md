OVERVIEW
The East Forty Caravan Expedition to the Corridor Wasteland has made camp next to the Jelm Mountain Resort. Relatively intact, Fairbanks explains that the lodge is typically vacant due to being infested with pests. He suggests that it would be worth clearing out to act as a home base for the expedition. Completing this quest rewards the player with dropped enemy loot, experience, and unlocking the Jelm lodge as player & companion housing.

BREAKDOWN

Once the Player has completed the intro slides to Fallout: Free Cheyenne, they'll be teleported to the Jelm Mountain Resort. Outside of the lodge, Mister Fairbanks will be introducing everyone in the party to the Corridor Wasteland and then draw the Player into dialogue.

Besides asking where to go first and various other questions, the Player can ask (or be asked by Fairbanks) about the Jelm lodge and why they aren't using it. Fairbanks will explain it's usually overrun by pests since few people want to spend the time and money to kill them if they only plan to stop there for a single night. Fairbanks will then go on to say that cleaning the lodge up might be worth the investment since the expedition will need a home base and may be an extended period of time. 

The Player will then start the quest upon confirming their intent to clear out the varmints inside. They can recruit any of the three companions at this point to help them out. 

Inside the lodge there are three floors of enemies. The ground and upper floors are typical giant mutated rat enemies the Player may have encountered before in the Mojave. However, in the kitchen there is a tunnel leading to the cave level that's a nest for the rats. At the end of the cave is a mini boss encounter featuring a larger than usual rat with more health and a special poison attack. 

Once all the rats are killed, the Player can tell Mister Fairbanks that the lodge is clear and the expedition can move in. 

REWARDS

ADDITIONAL NOTES
The Jelm Lodge is an important location for the Player to store items and have a home base in an unfamiliar world. It is also a key location for the Player to send and observe companions they recruit. The lodge is where companions will interact with each other and express their character. This quest should be put right in front of the Player so it is difficult to miss the content.
