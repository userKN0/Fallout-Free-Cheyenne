Quest Outline:

-Once The Gathering Storm has begun, the reality of the Sabines being forced to fight the Legion will hit Emily in full force. She will request for the player to help her convince the other Sabines to leave Free Cheyenne ahead of the Battle of the Corridor. This quest has two largely independent parts: one to deal with the Sabines and the other to help Emily come to terms with her decision. It might be better to break up into two, interlocking quests.

  

Emily’s Personal Quest: Emily is looking for confirmation bias to silence those last doubts that it’s her alone against the Sabines. 

There is an optional objective to explore the lore of pre-war Cheyenne and the Sabines. If the Cheyenne Museum is open for business and the player is in good standing with the museum owners, the player can learn about the history of the Cheyenne people. The book will detail the tribe’s history of betrayal by the U.S. government, forced displacement onto a reservation, their own exodus to the north and how the Cheyenne managed to maintain a form of independence.

  

If the player has done work for the Sabines and is in good standing with Free Cheyenne, the Sabine Elder can be persuaded to allow the player to access the Sacred Texts of the Sabines, some of the last books of Louisiana. These texts date from the Honilander times and are locked inside a waterproof container. The code to open the box was lost in the exodus and has to be opened with a Lockpick 90 / Strength 10 / or power drill. Opening it will reveal that the Honilanders and the Sabines were the same tribe.

  

Emily has to be read the Sacred Texts of the Sabines and The History of the Cheyenne Peoples by the player. The player can also lie to her about what the texts actually say, since she has no way of knowing the difference.

-If the player starts with the history of the Cheyenne, Emily will make her mind up right then and there to push unreservedly for the Sabines to leave, and it will not be possible to change her mind. 

-If the player starts with the Sacred Texts of the Sabines, then she will realize that she was incredibly ignorant of the Sabines’ history. She will request two days to think over this new knowledge.

-If the player reads both texts to Emily, then she will ask the player for input. The player can convince her to stay in Cheyenne if having dealt with some instances of discrimination against the Sabines in Free Cheyenne. This unlocks a 80 Speech check. The player can convince her to leave with a much lower Speech check that has no requirements.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

The Sabines Quest: Hank, the Sabine priest, and one of the heroes of the Sabine expedition against the Legion have to be convinced before the Sabine Elder will agree to prepare for a new exodus and formally break the alliance with Free Cheyenne.

  

Hank is the easiest to convince to leave Free Cheyenne, but he also views it as an obligation to Free Cheyenne to stay and continue fighting. He views his word as bond, and is unwilling to break his word, especially when the Sabines want to stay in Free Cheyenne.

-Repair a group of vehicles to the north that the Sabines can use to leave.

-Kill the Lincoln Highway Motel owner stealthily.

-Speech check.

  

The Sabine priest legitimately believes that Free Cheyenne is a promised land for the Sabines and is unwilling to have his tribe venture back out into the wastes.

-Convince Ammon of New Canaan to tell the priest that the New Canaanites prospered by venturing out into the wastes, and that’s how they survived. 

-Convince Father Mordecai to meet with the priest. Show how different their religions are, and the Sabine Priest will doubt that this is the promised land.

-Break into his home and plant paraphernalia to discredit him. Can either blackmail him to support the move, or say nothing to remove him as a factor.

  

The hero of the Sabine expedition, who made his name in helping the expedition survive and capture the Legion banner, is unwilling to leave Free Cheyenne. This is partially because doing so would make the expedition retroactively worthless and partially because the Sabines might not survive another exodus. 

-Rescue the Sabine women yourself.

  
  

Alternatively, just kill Hank, the priest and the hero while Emily isn’t watching. The Sabine Elder will conclude that Free Cheyenne is actively trying to kill the Sabines, and he will break the alliance right then and there.

  

Alternatively, if Emily is not in the party, you can harden their resolve and prevent them from leaving Free Cheyenne. Unless she already came to peace with staying, Emily will view this as a betrayal and will permanently leave the player’s party.
