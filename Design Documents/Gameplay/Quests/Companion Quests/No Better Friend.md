**BREAKDOWN**
In the town of Temperance, a quiet man can be found working at the local stables. After a short conversation, the Player Character learns his name is Decimus and he is a former soldier of Caesar's Legion. Before the Player Character leaves, Decimus asks them to help with a problem he is facing. The day before, Decimus was shot at by some Road Pirates who had holed up inside his prospecting claim in the Greeley ruins. If the Player will help get rid of them, they can have his salvage stockpile and whatever is on the raider bodies. 

With Decimus in tow as a temporary companion, the Player will fight some wasteland pests that have been living in the ruins. Upon entering Decimus' claim, the Player will be confronted by a hysterical Road Pirate pointing their gun at them. Talking with the raider reveals that his partner was wounded during a failed caravan robbery. With the others killed or captured, the two of them managed to flee into the ruins and find shelter. Without proper medical attention, however, the Road Pirate's friend lost too much blood and will soon die without immediate assistance. The Road Pirate begs the Player to help him.

The Player has several options to resolve this:

1. Attack and kill the Road Pirate. 
2. Promise to help the Road Pirate's partner only if he turns them both into the Marshals. 
3. Help the wounded man and let them both go. 
4. Leave and return after 24 hours. The wounded man will have died from blood loss and the other Road Pirate will have shot himself out of grief. 

Depending on the method, Decimus will respond positively or negatively. 

If the Player kills the Road Pirates outright, Decimus will be satisfied that retribution was carried out on the raiders for their crimes. 

If the Player convinces the Road Pirate to turn themselves over to the law, Decimus will be disappointed but respect the observance of justice. 

If the Player chooses to be merciful and heal the wounded raider, Decimus will be baffled and demand an explanation. The Player can explain their actions from a humanist perspective about giving them a second chance on life, or appeal to the Legion attitude that the ultimate insult is to be spared. 

If the Player does nothing and allows them to die, Decimus will begrudgingly acknowledge that it was fate they died, whether it was by the Player or by their own hand. 

With the Road Pirates dealt with, Decimus thanks the Player for helping them not just with getting his claim back, but for giving him a sign. Decimus admits he's been lost for years and was looking for anything from Mars that would show him on where to go and what to do with himself. Thanks to the Player's actions, Decimus will now travel with the Player Character as long as they'll have him. 

**REWARDS**
500 XP
Decimus as a companion
Assorted loot (TBD)

**ADDITIONAL NOTES**
The purpose of the recruitment quest for Decimus is to lay the groundwork for his ultimate fate at the conclusion of the game. If the player decides to show mercy on the Road Pirates, the decision will cause Decimus to reflect on his survival, his faith in Mars, and the possibility of him living a new life. This will allow the "good" ending for Decimus to be open to the player while completing [[Casting the Die]]. Conversely, condemning the Road Pirates to death either in part or whole will lock Decimus into his fate of either dying while attempting to kill Joshua Graham a second time or returning to Caesar to atone for his failure.
